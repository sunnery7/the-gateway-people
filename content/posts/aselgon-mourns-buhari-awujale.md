The Association of Ex-Local Government Chairmen of Nigeria (ASELGON) has described the deaths of two prominent Nigerians- former President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR and Oba Sikiru Kayode Adetona, Ogbagba II, the Awujale of Ijebu-Ode almost the same day as a terrible and devastating blow on the country.


ASELGON in a condolence statement  issued in Abuja by the association's National President, Hon. Albert Asipa, described the twosome as uncommon leaders. 


While commiserating with the families of the deceased, in Daura, Katsina State and Ijebu-Ode, Ogun State the association said they should be consoled by the records of service both gave to humanity as army general and politician as well as a traditional leader respectively.


Speaking of the late Gen. Buhari, ASELGON recalled that the late army officer came on two different occasions, first as a military head of state between 1983 and 1985 and secondly as a civilian president between 2015 and 2023 to offer leadership and the two occasions were remarkably significant in the political history of the country. 


On the two occasions, ASELGON noted that the late former president proved himself a patriotic, disciplined and focused leader who gave his all for the upliftment, progress and betterment of the country.


 "He would for long be remembered for his pragmatism, loyalty to nation building and commitment to all that is noble and worthy of a genuine leader", the association stated
On Oba Adetona, the former council chairmen said:  "the nation has lost a quintessential monarch, whose frankness and bluntness to a fault had no parallel. 


"A highly disciplined and reserved monarch, the late Awujale would be sorely missed by the country at large, the Yoruba race and his Ijebu-Ode subjects in particular. 


"It is very sad and painful to lose these two illustrious and prominent personalities at this particular point in the political history of Nigeria when their counsel and advice, based on their wealth of experience would be badly needed, but who are we to query the all knowing God on His decision?


"We thank God for their respective lives which in no small measure impacted on our society in diverse ways of politics and culture and traditions where the twosome separately successfully operated and pray that Almighty Allah would uphold their respective families", ASELGON further noted.


Asking for prayers for divine guidance for the country as she aspires for greatness and prosperity, ASELGON lamented the rate at which the country loses her leaders in quick succession
