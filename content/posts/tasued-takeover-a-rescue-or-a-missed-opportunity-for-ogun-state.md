The recent takeover of the Tai Solarin University of Education (TASUED) by the Federal Government has sparked mixed reactions. While some may see it as a lifeline, those who understand the institution's original vision recognize it as a missed opportunity for Ogun State.
 The model at TASUED’s conception, along with other institutions such as the ICT Polytechnics and the Gateway Industrial and Petrochemical Institute (GIPI), was designed to be self-sustaining, not a financial burden on the government.
The administration of Otunba Gbenga Daniel (OGD) provided seed funding and infrastructure to establish these institutions with the intent of making them attractive to students, donors, and corporate sponsorships. This model worked—at least initially. 
TASUED and Sapade Polytechnic, for example, successfully secured endowments, grants, and private sector partnerships, creating a template for self-financing higher education in Ogun State.
However, subsequent administrations either failed to grasp or neglected this vision. Instead of nurturing the model, they viewed these institutions as financial liabilities, leading to attempts at scrapping, merging, or underfunding them. 
This lack of strategic foresight ultimately justified the FG’s intervention, stripping Ogun State of what could have been a gold mine in the knowledge and digital economy.
With the right leadership, management, and policies, these institutions could have been revenue-generating assets for the state. In their early years, they achieved national and international recognition, proving their potential to attract investments. As someone who was involved in shaping their strategy and governance, I can attest to the structures that were put in place to ensure sustainability, including:
1. Attracting Private Sector Investment: High-net-worth individuals like Chief Adebutu and Chief Adegunwa were instrumental in securing sponsorships and endowments for these institutions. Proper engagement with more industry leaders could have expanded these funding sources.
2. Compulsory Executive Training Policies: The Ministry of Education had policies mandating leadership and subject-specialist training for primary and secondary school heads in Ogun, Lagos, and beyond, positioning TASUED as a center for educational excellence.
3. Digital Education Infrastructure: The EDUTAMS platform, developed for digital education management, is now used by the state government for school data management. Proper monetization could have generated significant revenue.
4. Management Development Programmes: TASUED played a role in training Ogun State’s civil servants through the MADEP program, which could have evolved into a full-fledged leadership institute, akin to the Awujale School of Governance.
5. Oil and Gas Sector Integration: GIPI had already established a pipeline for training skilled personnel, such as welders, for the oil and gas industry, attracting nationwide patronage.
6. International Partnerships: The Bureau of Tertiary Institutions, through the Human Capital Development Programme (HUCAP), forged relationships with international universities. This initiative had the potential to secure global funding and collaboration.
7. Global Recognition of Alumni: TASUED alumni have gained international acclaim, winning prestigious awards such as the Global Best Teacher Award and the Microsoft MVP in Technology Education. These accolades could have attracted further investment into the institutions.
Rather than fostering innovation and financial independence, Ogun State has chosen the easier route—handing over its assets to the Federal Government. This decision reflects a "beggar mentality," an unfortunate surrender of a state’s potential for significance and greatness.
In a world driven by knowledge and digital transformation, visionary leadership is needed to unlock the true value of our educational institutions. The FG’s intervention may seem like a short-term solution, but in the long run, Ogun State may have lost a critical economic and intellectual advantage.
God give us the leaders these times demand.
