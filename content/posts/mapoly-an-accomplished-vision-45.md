Polytechnics are post-secondary institutions that offer advanced technical education. 



The polytechnic model is hands-on and industry-responsive. They are fertile grounds to nurture graduates with technical and technological skills that are beneficial to societal development.



Taking cognisance of this fact, when in 1976, Ogun State was created out of the old Western State, those saddled with the responsibility of setting up the new state thought of a post-secondary education to supply needed manpower for the young state.



The then Military Administrator, Lt Col. Seidu Balogun with his team agreed on the creation of an educational Institution to produce the needed middle-level manpower for the development of the state.



Premised on this, the executive council considered the establishment of a college of technology which later was named polytechnic in the state. This lofty idea could not take off before the pioneer military administrator was given a matching order handing over to Brigadier Harris O. Eghagha to complete the process.



On January 31, 1979, Ogun State Polytechnic, Abeokuta was formally established with the turning of the sod by Brigadier Harris O. Eghagha.



On this day, the first set of students numbering 220 were admitted to actualise the vision which was to produce middle-level manpower for the state and the nation. The House of Assembly thereafter passed the law establishing the polytechnic.



The 220 students were admitted into 5 departments namely: Civil Engineering, Electrical Electronics Engineering, Business and Management Studies, Architecture and Town Planning and Preliminary Studies.



The Institution was by the edict of the house of assembly allocated 960 hectares of undeveloped land at Ojere in the outskirts of Abeokuta.



The initial takeoff was at Onikolobo Bishop’s Court for four departments and administrative activities while Oke Egunya played host to preliminary studies which were mainly science-based. The polytechnic moved to its permanent site at Ojere in 1985.



In the last forty-five years, the polytechnic has its name changed in 1999 after the death of its greatest benefactor, Chief M.K.O Abiola thereby becoming Moshood Abiola Polytechnic, MAPOLY, Abeokuta.



The school has grown from 220 students at inception to about 30,000 students and today about 15,000, with five departments back then to 45 programmes spread across 25 departments and 5 schools.



A question that someone asked was has MAPOLY achieved the objective of its establishment. I answered YES.



This Institution has not only become a household name and in hot demand by higher education seekers because of its quality products, employers also demand our products because of their quality. 



Today MAPOLY is one of the Institutions that parade over 100 Ph.D. holders among its teaching and non-teaching staff in different fields which has added value to the products in the market.



The Institution also give priority to skill development having started the centre for entrepreneurship as far back as 2008 to ensure that its graduates should be employers of labour instead of being in the labour market seeking jobs that do not exist.



Our Mass Communication graduates are executives in major media houses keeping the flag fly while upholding the tenets of the profession.



At least 2 to 4 of our accountancy students qualify as chartered accountants at every diet and this has been on from the inception of the polytechnic.



 MAPOLY has produced students who have made Nigeria great and are still contributing, among them is Mrs. Oluwatoyin Madein, the current Accountant General of the Federation.



With the help of Chief M.K.O Abiola, Moshood Abiola Polytechnic has one of the best libraries in this nation.



I must also say that MAPOLY has one of the best sports facilities, health centre, workshops and laboratories having gone around and seen the facilities on the ground in 2020, when the NBTE visited the polytechnic, the leader of the team said, “the board could not close its eyes and allow this institution which is a 2nd generation polytechnic and one of our pride to go into extinction. ”



The institution has been blessed with great manpower from the rector to the least person in the employment.



With nine rectors since inception, namely, Dr Tunji Sonola who was seconded on request by the state government from the University of Lagos followed by HRM Dr. Adebisi Adebayo now a royal father, also from the University of Lagos, followed by Dr Kehinde Jibodu from Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro, Alhaji Waheed Kadiri, Arc Tokunbo Fowode, ( both from the system) Prof. Oludele Itiola from the University of Ibadan, Dr Ayodeji Tella from the industry, Dr Adeola Odedina, from Federal College of Agriculture, Akure and Dr. Adeoye Odedeji incumbent bent. All have contributed to the development of the polytechnic.



MAPOLY has the best set of administrative officers that have impacted its development from Mrs Kunbi Oyejide who laid the foundation for the first substantive registrar Amb. (Mrs) Aderonke Folarin to Mr. Wole Abiodun followed by Major Abdul-Azeez Badmos Rtd.,( Late) Mr Oluyemi Olumide, Mr Emmanuel Adeleye and Mrs Olubunmi Elewodalu, the incumbent.



The institution played key roles in supporting the establishment of five polytechnics by the Otunba Gbenga Daniel administration by supplying both administrative and bursary staff to assist in setting the standard.



The part-time programme has assisted in boosting the quality of manpower for the Ogun State government and neighbouring states.



Our students are doing well at home and abroad in their areas of endeavour and this has been the pride of the polytechnic and the forefathers who planted the seed of Ogun State Polytechnic now Moshood Abiola Polytechnic.
