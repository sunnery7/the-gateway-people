Come Monday, July 15, the venerable Chief Olusegun Osoba will clock 85. I celebrate his enduring imprint on the fabric of Nigeria’s story. 



Osoba’s distinguished career, a testament to his unwavering dedication and unrelenting passion, has traversed the realms of journalism, politics, and traditional leadership, elevating him to the esteemed position of elder statesman.



Osoba’s journalistic prowess was evident in his investigative reporting, notably uncovering the fate of Prime Minister Tafawa Balewa’s body, at a remote village, Ijako in the present Ado-Odo Ota local government, some 120 miles to where the premier was gruesomely murdered, in 1966. 



His coverage of the Nigeria civil war and editorship of Daily Times, then Nigeria’s most authoritative newspaper, solidified his reputation as a seasoned reporter.



When he joined the Octogenarians’ club five years ago, Baba used the occasion to launch his memoirs, “Battlelines: Adventures in Journalism and Politics”.



On that occasion, former President Mouhammadu Buhari, among other statesmen attested to his (Osoba’s) loyal party membership, transformative leadership and lasting impact.



The ex-president eulogized him for his dedication to building robust institutions and participatory democracy, saying in the formation of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Osoba not only did Osoba served as chairman of its constitution drafting committee, but played pivotal role to accomplish the first defeat of an incumbent President (Goodluck Jonathan) in the nation’s history, a salute to his political sagacity, networking skill and pan-NIgerianism.



In that captivating memoir, Osoba recounts his remarkable journey from humble beginnings in journalism to becoming a prominent politician, offering valuable lessons on preparation, networking, risk-taking, and record-keeping.



 As a reporter, Osoba’s determination to succeed is evident in his ability to save up for a telephone line, a luxury reserved for the wealthy at the time. With candid insight, he shares his personal life, relationships, and political experiences, humanizing the public figure and showcasing his vulnerable side.



Osoba’s dignity and dedication to democratic values were evident even when his son, Olumide, sought to return to the House of Representatives. Rather than wielding his legendary stature, Osoba skillfully navigated the political landmines, leveraging his power and respect for due process to successfully secure his son’s candidacy. 



This demonstrates a masterful blend of political savvy and dedication to democratic values, solidifying Osoba’s legacy as a true statesman.



During the 3rd Republic, he joined forces with others to advocate for the restoration of Chief MKO Abiola’s stolen mandate, showcasing his dedication to justice and fairness. Since then, Osoba’s political acumen and strategic thinking have been instrumental in maintaining unity and cohesion within his the larger political family. 



His ability to build bridges, foster alliances, and navigate complex political landscapes has earned him a reputation as a master strategist and statesman.



His leadership in Ogun State, both under diarchy and in the 4th Republic, demonstrates his adaptability and dedication to public service. His commitment to the people’s welfare is evident in his wise and compassionate leadership.



In his native Ogun State, Chief Osoba is a venerable figure, esteemed by traditional rulers and political leaders alike. Honoured with the esteemed titles of Araba Yewa, Aremo Awujale, and Akinrogun Egba, by the Paramount rulers across the three senatorial districts, Osoba has been a bridge between modernity and tradition, an Oluwo in his primordial Oba, embodying the values of his ancestors while embracing progress.



Despite any attempts to diminish his legacy, the indelible mark he has left on infrastructure development, particularly in the hearts of the rural communities he has touched, remains evergreen.



The people of Ipokia local government, especially those in Wheke Akere, will forever be grateful for Osoba’s contributions, which have brought electricity to their communities, transforming their lives, livelihoods, and living standards.



 His impact will continue to be felt for generations to come, a shining example of the lasting difference one person can make.



Furthermore, Osoba’s stature and character were evident in his decision to maintain a dignified distance from his successors for 16 years, declining to engage in petty politics or seek to undermine their authority.



 Instead, he chose to focus on his legacy and contributions to the state’s development. It was only when the third successor came to office, while I was Chief Press Secretary, that Osoba’s stature was formally recognized with the dedication of a press centre, in his honour at the state secretariat.



To former military President Ibrahim Babangida Osoba is a dedicated journalist and a “civilian general” who has made a significant impact in the political sphere. 



Governor Dapo Abiodun has also commended Osoba’s commitment to the well-being of citizens, his wisdom, mentorship, and integrity, describing him as a “good man” and a “political mentor” who has inspired many. 



President Bola Ahmed Tinubu has similarly praised Osoba’s achievements as a pioneer journalist and pro-democracy activist, noting his ability to offer wise counsel to others in the political class.



Osoba has consistently demonstrated his commitment to principle and decorum, even in the face of provocation. For instance, during the controversial tenure of Ibikunle Amosun, Osoba wisely chose to withdraw from the political fray, assuming the role of a respected kingmaker. 



Today, the current governor acknowledges Osoba as a father figure, and his leadership style is distinct from that of other political godfathers. 



He has never imposed his preferences on state policies, projects, or selection of aides, instead allowing merit and competence to guide decision-making.



Osoba’s dignity and dedication to democratic values were evident even when his son, Olumide, sought to return to the House of Representatives. 



Rather than wielding his legendary stature, Osoba skillfully navigated the political landmines, leveraging his power and respect for due process to successfully secure his son’s candidacy. 



This demonstrates a masterful blend of political savvy and dedication to democratic values, solidifying Osoba’s legacy as a true statesman.



His unwavering commitment to journalism excellence and ethics has been a beacon of hope in an industry beset by challenges. 



His voice of reason resonates loudly through various platforms, including the International Press Institute, Nigerian Guild of Editors, Newspapers Proprietors Association of Nigeria, Nigeria Union of Journalists, at the most basic level.



 He has inspired a new generation of journalists to embrace the values of ethical reporting, factual accuracy, and responsible storytelling. 



His contributions to the development of journalism in Nigeria have been invaluable, and his legacy of fact-based reporting, ethical conduct, and responsible media practice extends beyond the newsroom.



Born James Olusegun Osoba to esteemed parents, he pursued professional courses and earned the esteemed Nieman Fellowship Award for journalism in 1974, becoming the first Nigerian to receive this prestigious honour. 



Married to Aderinsola, the Beere Awujale of Ijebu, they have four children who continue to be a source of pride and joy for the family. 



Here is a wish for many more years of service to journalism practice and statesmanship by the quintessential man of all seasons.
