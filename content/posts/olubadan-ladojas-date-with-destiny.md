In every true son of Ibadan, there’s a potential Olubadan. However, becoming Olubadan is a long haul of climbing 23-step rungs of either of the two chieftaincy ladders: Olubadan line (civil) and Balogun line (Military).


While the Obaship system and ascension to the coveted throne of Olubadan is unique and predictable, getting to the top of the ladder means a gift of long life for the highest ranking chiefs of the ancient Yorùbá capital city of Oyo State.


Becoming Olubadan is on rotational basis between the two lines of ascension to the throne headed by Ọtun Olubadan (Civil line) and Balogun (Military line). But in recent years, over a decade, there have been two high chiefs and of course, next-in-lines to the throne who never get to the Olubadan throne.
High Chief Sulaimon Adegboyega Omiyale was the Balogun of Ibadan land and next-in-line to Oba Samuel Odulana Odugade 1, the 40th Olubadan who reigned from 11th of August, 2007 to 19th of January, 2016 and died at the age of 101 years.


With Oba Odulana, who succeeded Oba Yinusa Ogundipe Arapasowu 1, as next-in-line from the Civil line, it was supposed to be the turn of High Chief Omiyale, had it been he lived to succeed the aged monarch.


But the Balogun of Ibadan land died on Saturday, 7th November, 2015 at the University College Hospital, UCH, Ibadan, at the age of 91.
Two months after his death, the reigning Olubadan, Oba Odulana died on 19th January, 2016.


High Chief Omowale Kuye was the Ọtun Olubadan, traditional head of the Civil line. With Omiyale’s death, Kuye was a step closer to becoming Olubadan but he also didn’t live to succeed the monarch.Kuye, who was a former Director General, Special Duties and later Budget in the Office of the President of Nigeria — under both Alhaji Shehu Shagari and General Olusegun Obasanjo — died on 20th November, 2015; barely two weeks after the demise of Balogun of Ibadan land.


Because of the earlier death of Balogun Omiyale whose line was supposed to produce the next monarch after the reigning Olubadan, High Chief Kuye would’ve become the next Olubadan being the highest ranking of the Olubadan-in-Council, but he also passed on before Oba Odulana.


Additionally, the demise of both Balogun Omiyale and Ọtun Olubadan Kuye, paved the way for the then Otun Balogun, Saliu Akanmu Adetunji, who eventually succeeded Oba Odulana as the 41st Olubadan in 2016. He was also succeeded in 2022 by the recently deceased 42nd Olubadan, Oba Lekan Balogun, Alli Okunmade II.


Following the death of Oba Lekan Balogun, the next-in-line was the then Balogun from the Military line; Oba Owólabí Ige Olakulehin who passed away in the early hours of Monday, July 7, 2025.
His passing not only marks the end of a significant chapter in the city’s storied monarchy but also signals the commencement of a transition process guided by the long-established traditional hierarchy of succession within Ibadanland.


In accordance with this time-honoured order, the next in line to ascend the throne is the current Otun Olubadan of Ibadanland, High Chief Rasidi Adewolu Ladoja. A former Governor of Oyo State, Chief Ladoja is widely respected both in political and traditional circles for his statesmanship and deep-rooted connection to the Ibadan chieftaincy system.


Subject to formal ratification by the Olubadan-in-Council and subsequent approval by the relevant authorities, Chief Ladoja is poised to become the 43rd Olubadan of Ibadanland—continuing the city’s legacy of orderly, peaceful, and lineage-based succession.


It will be recalled that in August 2024, while speaking on a live radio programme titled Agbami Oselu, High Chief Ladoja expressed a profound sense of destiny regarding his potential ascension. In his words, “By the grace of God, I will become Olubadan. God has been merciful to me. My blood pressure has remained stable.”


He further emphasised that divine will supersedes human interference, stating, “Anyone God has destined to become Olubadan will become Olubadan. No matter the obstacles placed in the path, if God ordains it, it will come to pass.”


Reflecting on his long-standing involvement in the chieftaincy progression, Ladoja also referenced political tensions from the past, notably during the administration of the late Governor Abiola Ajimobi. He asserted, “What I know is that it is the Olubadan who is meant to effect amendments to the system, not the governor.”


He concluded his remarks with a message of humility and service: “I will do what the people of Ibadan want. Everything is determined by God. We have had many who attained the ranks of Balogun or Otun Olubadan but never became Olubadan. It is all about destiny.”


With Chief Ladoja now positioned as the natural successor, all eyes turn to the traditional institutions for a formal announcement that will usher in a new era for the ancient city of Ibadan.
