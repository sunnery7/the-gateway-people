The couple, who also visited the music icon, Evangelist (Dr.) Ebenezer Obey Fabiyi said not only the Yoruba nation but Nigeria has lost a true warrior.



"A warrior without gun or grenade except her boldness to speak the truth, stand for the truth and fight for it. 



"She was not just a defender of the female gender but a woman who stood for justice for mankind. A friend to anyone as long as you defend and protect  the weak" She can be a friend to the party or person in power ( government) but she will not hesitate to resist same when you abuse the privilege of your office". 



"She is not only an educationist but a great entrepreneur and encourager of the young to grow. She is not afraid to give others opportunity to rise"

 

"A bridge builder and lover of people. As NACCIMA boss, sometimes when she travels, she  makes contact with pastors overseas and advertise Victory Life Bible Church and Lawrence Achudume, she will return with contacts and ensures communication"

 

 "A teacher per excellence. Call her an activist, a rebel with a genuine course for the good of humanity and you will not be wrong".



"Chief Alaba Lawson stood tall among women (and men?). She will be difficult to replace, her type is scarce, she was among the very few of her specie in a nation of... 



"Her voice is actually needed now in our nation but she is gone. She has finished her race.



"I pray the Lord give comfort to her family and close associates. Good night the peoples' defender and teacher of many who are making Nigeria proud across the world", he stated.
