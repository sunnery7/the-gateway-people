Aderupoko is a household  name in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital.
However, not many residents of the rock city are aware that "Aderupoko" is just a nick name.
One of the forebears ef the "Aderupokos" was Chief Isaac Olufusibi Coker (a.k.a Aderupoko).
He was the first Oluwo of Itesi, in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital in 1897.
A  prosperous farmer and trader, the Itesi chief came about his nickname through the overloading the canoes carrying his merchandise from Lagos to Abeokuta via the  River Ogun.
History says that people on sighting such overloaded canoe, would exclaim: "Ha A-da-eru-pa-oko!", hence, he was nicknamed "Aderupoko".

An outstanding generous and philanthropist, Coker was said to be the first to carry the mace of Ogboni (i.e. Edan Opa ase Ogboni) - staff of authority of Ogboni - from the former Itesi town, Itesi in Abeokuta. 
The Egba chief was also ranked among guarantors for the £30,000 loan for Abeokuta's electrification and supply of pipe-borne water in 1913. 
Between 1887-1892, the Egba chiefs invited him to become the Alake of Abeokuta but his senior brother, Chief Samuel Sowemimo Coker disallowed.
This was because of the fear that most of the Alake's then died prematurely.

During the war, he recruited his own soldiers and that was why the boundary between Abeokuta and Ibadan (in Bakatari) was taken over by him.
Also, the boundary between Remo and Egbas (in Fidiwo) was taken over by "Aderupoko" to check the advancements of his enemies.
That is why up to this date, the boundary lands in Fidiwo and Bakatari are still in the possession of his children.
