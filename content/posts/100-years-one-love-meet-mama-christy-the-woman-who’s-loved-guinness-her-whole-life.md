Not many people can say they’ve loved something for close to a century — but Mama Christiana Atoke Egberongbe can.

If you’ve ever wondered what loyalty looks like, meet Mama Christy, a remarkable grandmother who just turned 100 years old and still lights up at the sight of her favourite drink: Guinness.

A Life Well Lived

Born in 1925 in Ajegunle Village, Oke Adiyan, Ogun State, Mama Christiana’s life has been a powerful blend of grit, entrepreneurship, and unwavering faith. From selling fruits in her youth to becoming widely known for her unforgettable rice and beans, she built a life deeply rooted in community, service, and grace.

But through the many chapters of her journey, one thing has remained constant — her love for Guinness.

A Toast to a Century

To mark this incredible milestone, the Guinness Nigeria team curated a special birthday “Love Box” just for her. The box included:

Branded merchandise

Bottles of Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (FES) and Guinness Smooth

A specially made birthday cake in her honour

The moment Mama Christy received the gift, her smile said it all. Overcome with joy, she broke into a long, heartfelt prayer for the makers of the drink she’s enjoyed for nearly a hundred years.

Legacy and Love

Now residing in Lagos, Mama Christy was surrounded by family across three generations as the Guinness team called in to sing her a birthday song. Her home overflowed with warmth, gratitude, and laughter — a true celebration of her life and her legendary loyalty to the black liquid gold she’s always loved.

From Guinness to Mama Christy — and to fans across Nigeria who have made Guinness part of their lives — here’s to long life, love, and legacy.
