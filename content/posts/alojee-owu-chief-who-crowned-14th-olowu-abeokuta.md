Many Owu chiefs played important roles in the coronation of Oba Saka Matemilola, Oluyalo Otileta VII as the 14th Olowu of Owu-Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital.



Prominent among them was Alojee, an Owu chieftaincy title which is currently occupied by Chief Babatunde Adio Ojerinde, a septuagenarian.



For the records, the Alojee chieftaincy title is limited to a particular family and a compound in Owu-Abeokuta



An Alojee is the custodian of the Owu crowns including the ancestral one  brought from Owu homestead and first worn by the first Olowu in Abeokuta, Oba Adeyanju Pawu in 1855.



Although Chief Ojerinde is said to be the 8th Alojee in Owu-Abeokuta, he has been Iwole Alojee for the past 19 years before he eventially became an Alojee in the past 7 years.



Iwole Alojee is an assistant to Alojee as latter's responsibities are said to be enormous that he could not handle alone.



As the custodian of the ancient Owu crowns, he is traditionally and culturally charged with the responsibility of crowni ng a new Olowu before he receives the formal staff of office from the Ogun State Government.



For Oba Saka Adelola  Matemilola, Oluyalo Otileta VII,  his coronation  held  5 days  before his official installation by the Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun.

Alojee's traditional assignment started immediately after the election process of Oba Matemilola  stopped.



He is also one of those responsible for the cultural and traditional tutelage of a new Olowu while in seclusion for three months.



It is Alojee among others including Obamagbo that leads the Olowu-elect to seclusion.



On his part, Abore is responsible  for performing necessary traditional and cultural rites for the new Olowu before he enters Itapa as well as during his stay there and after.



Also, the entry of a new Olowu is subject to performance of many traditional rites by many Owu chiefs including Alojee and Oluwo Ifa of Owu before he could be allowed to step into seclusion.



While in seclusion, the Olowu performed many customary rites as well as went through several tutelages by different Owu chiefs.
