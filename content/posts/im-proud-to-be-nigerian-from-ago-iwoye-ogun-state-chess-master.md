Since you are now officially our Sports Ambassador and our Chess Ambassador, we will leave it to you to design that competition from the local government all the way to the state level.



“But we as your state, we will have a sponsor in the Tunde Onakoya Prize, for the winner of that competition,” the governor explained.



Abiodun likened the travails of the chess master to that of millions of youths in Nigeria who are struggling to make something out of their lives.
