From Ipokia to Imeko; from Ota to Ayetoro and back to Ilaro, and indeed Yewa in Abeokuta North Area of Imala, Ilewo- Orílẹ̀, Isaga-Orile and over the world, the challenges and opportunities are the same as far as their fathers land is concerned



So, to address the challenges and savour the potent and latent opportunities, these knitted sub-ethnic group converged on the Airport Hotel, Ikeja, Lagos to dissect their concerns to evolve agreed action for common solutions.



The hall, Oranmiyan hall, may have been chosen without a thought on the significance and symbolism of how it resonates with the agenda of the people, it is symbolic, because after the talks, it is clear as crystal that Ọ̀RỌ̀ WA TI YÀN(JU) (our direction is settled in terms of the set agenda.)



Dateline was May 11, the setting as aforemrntioned, the dramatis personae were royally led by no other person than the Paramount ruler of Yewaland and Olu of Ilaro, Oba Kehinde Olugbenle, Asade Agunloye 1V. 



He was proxied by a retinue of Obas, namely the Olu of Imasayi, Oba Lukmon Kuoye, the Onimeko of Imeko, Oba Benjamin Olanite, among others. In his personal capacity, the Alaketu of Ketu, Lagos State, Oba Oyero Balogun, Ilufemiloye 1 was an early seater, may be for the importance he attached to the matter of common concern irrespective of location



All this was at the instance of the Yewaland Development Forum (YDF), formerly known as Yewa Union, Lagos. It was its 8th Talk series, christened  "Yewas Talk," themed: "Yewaland: Harnessing out Potential and opportunities towards 2027 and beyond," wherein the quintessential medical doctor-politician and social development enthusiast, Dr. Iziaq Kunle Salako, spoke on the need to dangle the carrot and deploy the stick, if and when necessary. 



This is the icing on the cake for most analytically concerned minds. "While the political class will work hard to bring everyone on the route to achieving the target by not merely dangling the carrot but releasing it, our paramount ruler and indeed all our Obas will be ready and handy to dish  out the stick to any outlaws and saboteurs who may want to truncate our collective dream," Salako quipped to a thunderous applause. 



From benefit of hindsight, this singular route was and remains the only untaken road in the peoples past efforts, thereby allowing individual interest superintend over the collective interest of a blessed race yet to showcase its best in administering Ogun State as governor since creation in 1976.



The guest lecturer, who was copiously unveiled to the distinguished audience which included captains of industries, the members of the academia, youth association and the Iyaloja General of Ogun State, Chief Mrs. Yemisi Abbas, by the compere, Omooba Femi Dokunmu, underscored the import of synegy and alliance to clinching the governorship seat come 2027 at an event where a former vice-chancellor of the University of Lagos, Professor Rahman Bello was the chief host, arm-cuddling Mr. Wasiu Niyi Fagbohun, the host.



"We need to synergise within and without; we just need to re-oil all relationships be it marital, business, social, religious and otherwise, more importantly with our brothers and sisters in Ogun East and Ogun Central Senarorial districts," irrespective of what our fathers have historically told us that a particular senatorial people are Yewa peoples" friend. 



Nobody could decipher which is richer between the roll call of attendees and the didactic fecundity of the lecture by the Hon. Minister of State for Environment, Dr. Salako. 



Hear him on the power of synegy and alliance: "when we truly synergise, we can all progress. 2027 is the year for Ogun West to reset and be set free.



Divisions and confusion can end our agenda. If we work together,  there is nothing we can't achieve," the ubiquitous Minister with versatility prophetically declare.



 It was a culture-laden event where the crooner of Bolojo genre of indigenous Music,  Jossy  Friday Elegbede serenaded his audience with his oldies which was evergreen and infectious.



 Ludare Olatunji of Sabada fame was on band stand, dishing it out solemly with penetrating vibes, ocassioned by his men's talking drum. Kòkòrò Imasayi/Iboro, the official snack at UNILAG when Professor Bello was vice-chancellor was mealed as first course at the event chaired by a former ICAN president and 8th National Assembly Senator, Chief Felix Kola Bajomo, the Apesin of Ayetoro. 



FKB it was who played the familiar tune of 'its Yewas turn", saying, "We will do first term, we will do second term," which then gain traction on the day which Emeritus Professor of History, Prof. Anthony Asiwaju was conspicuos. 



Before it got to its climax, the senator representing Ogun West at the 10th National Assembly, Senator Solomon Olamilekan Adeola-YAYI, the Grand Patron of the YDF (newly investiture), touched down  in company of the minister-guest lecturer and hordes of former federal lawmakers and personal aides to a rousing welcome.



The Senator, who doubles as the Aremo of Yewaland responded with equal conviviality, releasing his infectious smile amid "May God honour you" as he had a handshake with his kinsmen. 



Ludare serenaded the audience as a filler before the Aremo's train berthed at exactly 12: 34pm that eventful Saturday. Before Professor Bello performed the investiture of Adeola-YAYI as Grand Patron, President of YDF, Mr. Fagbohun had taken the distinguished audience through the trajectory of the YDF in his welcome address even as he lined his entire executive council members behind him in case his "oversized shoe" left by his predecessor attempt to fall him!.That really passed for a thespian comedy.



 He cited the achievements of the forum from the cradle up untill the talk-of-the-town and the decisive 8th edition, which drew Prince Jacob Akindele, member of the Guardian Newspapers Editorial Board and Special Adviser, Infrastructure, to the former Governor Gbenga Daniel of Ogun State. Hon. Lai Taiwo, political juggernaut and Are Onakakanfo of Aworiland. 



The apex body, a political association being ably led by Chief Muftau Akande Ajibola were well represented. Mr. Fagbohun urged the senator to help actualised the YDF House in Lagos, the prototype of which was inserted in the programme for all to see.



Whilst performing the investiture, Professor Bello, Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of Council, Tai Solarin University of Education (TASUED) recalled how Senator Adeola-YAYI had been impactful during the formative years of Yewa Union as a young member, long before now.



In his acceptance speech, laden with his intervention projects and programmes, Adeola reminded me of the philosophy of the American author,  Albert Pike that: "What we have done for ourselves alone dies with us; what we have done for others and the world remains and it is immortal."



Responding to YDF request on securing a one-stop-shop entrepenurial House in Lagos, he said a joint action would be required to know the state which the project has reached, whether a land had been bought and so on and so forth. 



The frank-talk embedded carnival-like yet reflective gathering of kinsmen came to a close getting to the dusk. 



The near-night fall saw the brothers and sisters exchanging departure pleasantries, with elecrifying high hope of savouring better years politically and in terms of development.
