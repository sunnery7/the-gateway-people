The name, Hon. Lanre Jaji, rings a bell any day especially in Ogun State. 
If not for anything, he is a frequent phone caller on the airwaves, particularly radio, on issues germane to the matters of polity and the economy.


Besides, Jaji who prides himself as Speaker of the Peoples’ Parliament, projects the image of a man of the people whose mission on earth is deepening good governance and rendering assistance and support to needy people and making life comfortable for them.


Recently, when he turned 62 on June 26, 2025, it was an occasion used to dispense the goodies of life and succour to hundreds of patients on admission at the State Hospital, Ijaiye, Abeokuta, and sundry other locations in Ogun State.


Under the aegis of his pet project, Larry Jay Free Health Care Foundation of which he is the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, the birthday was celebrated in his peculiar manner of marking the event with the under-privileged in the society.


First to benefit from Lanre Jaji’s milk of kindness were orphans and motherless children of Stella Obasanjo Children Home, GRA, Ìbarà Housing Estate with presentation of food items and others.


The celebrant was accompanied by a coterie of eminent personalities, among them the Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, represented by his Special Adviser on Media and Strategy, Hon. Kayode Akinmade and the Special Adviser to the Governor on SDG and Water Resources, Hon. Damilola Otubanjo.
Of course, the celebrant’s better half, Alhaja M.O. Jaji who is also consultant to the governor on Water Resources, was also in attendance.


Next was the visit to the State Hospital, Ijaiye, Abeokuta where assorted drugs were donated to the Emergency Treatment Unit(ETR) free of charge.


Jaji, who graduated from the University of Lagos, Akoka, bagging a Bachelor’s degree in Chemistry, jetted out to Amsterdam, Netherlands at the Institute of Water Resources for more studies sometimes around 2011.
He has worked in sundry health facilities in the state as head of pharmacy before he retired from the civil service many years ago after a meritorious 31 years.


The Larry Jay Free Health Care Foundation started sometimes around 2007as a way of giving back to the society.


Alhaji Olanrewaju Isa Jaji(his official name) tells the story himself
 “Whatever we have been able to do so far came from my monthly salary and whatever God has given me to assist my fellow human beings. God is my sponsor.


“We go about visiting hospitals and helping to defray the medical bills of indigent patients. This we do in order to assist the less privileged patients on admission on emergency at the ETR.


“For me, there’s no better way of serving mankind than what I'm currently doing; working for humanity. 
"Whatever I am doing is borne out of love and compassion for my fellow human.


“I am a fulfilled man today because God has used the foundation to save the lives of many patients who could have died because of inability to pay their bills. God has been very faithful.”, he stated.
