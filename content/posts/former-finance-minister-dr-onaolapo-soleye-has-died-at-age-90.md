He turned ninety years only last Saturday.



“Papa served the country and humanity in various capacities rising to the position of an Associate Professor in the University of Ibadan, Commissioner for Works in Ogun State and Minister of Finance of the Federal Republic of Nigeria amongst others.



“He was a true lover of God and humanity and this translated into his unwavering commitment to church activities as well as ready support and assistance to all who came across him, in any way that he could.



“The loss of Dr. Soleye is surely not that of the Soleye family alone. It’s our father that has just passed and we must all prepare to be part of his rites of passage.



“Burial details will be announced by the family in due course. Until then, please pray for the repose of Papa’s soul and God’s comfort upon his family and other loved ones.



“May the soul of Dr Onaolapo Soleye rest in peace. Amen”



Meanwhile, the Senator representing Ogun East and former governor, Otunba Gbenga Daniel has described him as a “remarkable man whose unwavering dedication to acts of kindness and good deeds impacted greatly on a lot of people.”



In a statement personally signed by him said: “I bear true testimony to the facts about Dr. Soleye as a great leader, a mentor and a man of impeccable principles who inspired countless individuals. As an alumnus of the Baptist Boys High School, Abeokuta, he was a great inspiration and mentor to many of us.



“As a former Commissioner for Finance in Ogun State and later as Minister for Finance of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Dr. Soleye distinguished himself as a prudent financial manager and acquitted himself as a first class economic administrator in the application of Nigeria’s resources. His commitment to a better Nigeria was unwavering.



“The passage of Dr. Soleye is a personal loss to me because I share very deep relationships with him as a younger friend and confidant. I benefited immensely from his several unconditional supports during trying times.



“My deepest condolences to members of his family; the Olowu of Owu Kingdom, Oba Matemilola; His Excellency, Chief Olusegun Aremu Obasanjo, GCFR, former President and Commander-in-Chief of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (who is also Dr. Soleye’s bosson friend); sons and Daughters of Owu Kingdom and Egbaland in general at this painful and trying times as I am consoled by the legacy of good deeds and forthrightness that Dr. Soleye left behind.”he stated
