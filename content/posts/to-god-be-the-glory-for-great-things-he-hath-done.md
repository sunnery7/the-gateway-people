To God be the Glory for great things He hath done.



My appointment as a Permanent Secretary in the Ogun State Civil Service is purely a divine mercy. Aanu ni mo ri gba. I return the Glory to you God.



I, and on behalf of my family, extend our profound gratitude and appreciation to His Excellency, the Executive Governor of our dear State, Prince Adedapo Abiodun "omo Baba Tisa" for the privilege and the confidence reposed in my personality for this honour. 



Your Excellency, sir, permit me this outburst of gratitude to your esteem person publicly. Reason, I am overwhelmed with joy and thanksgivings. Thank you sir.



I am equally indebted to you, the Secretary to the State Government, a very hard-working, God fearing and disciplined personality, Mr Tokunbo Talabi for your great service to the state in all fronts. Thank you sir.



Moreso, my appreciation to the present Head of Service in the state, a very strategic, honest, hardworking, humble and God fearing gentleman, Mr Kehinde Onasanya. 



" Strategy one", Your tenure is definitely a divine one as its positive evidences since your few days in office, has continued to manifest greatly to the socio-economic development of the state and the welfare of the State work force. Thank you sir. 



To all retired,  but not tired permanent secretaries, serving ones, members of my family, colleagues, friends and other well wishers, I am very grateful for your concern, thoughtfulness, love and prayers, particularly your words of encouragement, overwhelming congratulatory messages and presence at my swearing in ceremony.



I pray, such goodness and mercy would be your portion in Jesus name, amen. 



More importantly, I have taken this appointment as another opportunity to work harder, a call for advance service to our great state as I promise to serve with all my strength and uplift the glory of God in my scheme of things, so help me God. 



Once again, I thank you all.



Signed

Ogunyinka Bernard Olanrewaju
