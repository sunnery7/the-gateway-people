My dear Abeke, our wedding was tagged: 'Wedding of the Tee-Jays' and it has continued to yield fruits that anyone can be proud of. 

You have been dedicated to your family and work, the accolades and goodwill messages of those who have crossed your path at one time or the other are manifestation of your good heart. You have always wished people goodness and success.

Attaining 60 years of age is not a small feat, but Allah in His infinite mercy Grant people many more, I wish you many more years in good health and happiness. As you age, May Allah, the Healer, the Refresher, the Provider manifest all these attributes in your life.

My dear TJ as fondly called by friends who know you well, you have been faithful and have always wished the best for the family, we have weathered some storms together and Allah made us triumph - I love and cherish you. 

Now that you are retired, May Allah not make you tired. It is time for you to enjoy and Allah shall make it easy. 

You have been a good wife, sister, friend, mother and companion. May God not separate us now. 

Happy birthday and retirement celebration. 

Ayo ni o! Ire ni o. Big, Big, Big Gbosa for you.

**\- - Engr. Olori Tajudeen (Husband)**
