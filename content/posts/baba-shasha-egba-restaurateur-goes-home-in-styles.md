It was a triumphant return home to glory for the late Abeokuta-based restaurateur, Pa Joseph Oluwole Adeneye Oderinde, (a.k.a "Shasha").


Oderinde, who hailed from Sanyaolu Olobe Village in Odeda Local Government Area of Ogun State was born into the family of the late Chief Abraham Adekunle Oderinde (a.k a B' omode O ku) and the late Madam Adeline Olufemi Oderinde.


His formal education started at the St Peter's Anglican Primary School, Ake, Abeokuta in 1950.
He later proceeded to the famous Abeokuta Grammar School in 1957 from where he graduated in 1961. 
While in primary and secondary schools, young Joseph used to assist his father who then owned B'omoode  ku Bookshop in the sales of "Iwe Itam Abeokuta and calendar for so many years.


He later worked briefly as a clerical officer in the Ministry of Works, Abeokuta and after many years of sojourn moved to the West African Beer Factory, brewers of the defunct Top Beer.
Later trained as a brewer-mate by the  Germans, Oderinde was also at the  Technical College, Ibadan, for a supervision training.


In the quest for independence, Oderinde, left the brewery to establish "Shasha" Hotel" as well as the restaurant segment with his wife, Mrs. Christiana Mopelola Oderinde after they got married in 1975.
The octogenarian returned home to his creator last May and was giving a befitting burial by his wife, children, friends, family members among others.


Notable among his friends of decades is the Alake and paramount ruler of Egbaland,  Oba Adedotun Aremu Gbadebo, Okukenu IV, who stood by him in live and in death.


Even in affluence, prominence and wealth, Oba Gbadebo, never denied his long time friendship with "Shasha"
On his part, Oderinde, long before his transition, was fond of Oba Gbadebo, singing praises of him at all times, describing him as a rare friend in deed.


"Shasha", was always excited and quick in letting anyone knows his age-long relationship with the paramount ruler.
