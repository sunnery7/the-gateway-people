Shout out to Mr. Tokunbo Oloruntola affectionately called "Baba News" for his abiding love for news gathering, reporting and dissemination.


I first met the accomplished veteran journalist in 2003 when he was News Editor at Daily Independent. 
Our paths crossed again on the Editorial Board of Rockcity FM, Abeokuta about three years ago.
Mr. Oloruntola once served as State House Correspondent of Punch newspaper at Dodan Barracks and worked in a couple of newspapers including Diet, TNT, Anchor and was a founding member of Radio Lagos. 


The phenomenon had trained legion of accomplished journalists and broadcasters.
 His commitment to the journalism profession is second to none!


I only got to know about his birthday when one of his daughters called to congratulate him whilst I was with him today (May 5,2025).


Please help to congratulate him and wish him the very best in very good health, unlimited blessings, closer walk with Jesus and peace like a river!


Hearty congratulations sir!
