All roads will literarily lead to Abeokuta, the city under the indomitable Olumo rock on Friday,  28th November, 2025 as Hon. Akeem Akintayo Amosun, (MBA FCIB, FCS) bids his mother farewell.
The Federal Commissioner, Revenue Allocation Mobilisation and Fiscal Commission's mother transited on Wednesday 9th October, 2025.


The young, vibrant, dynamic grassroot politician  is leaving no stone unturned,  reaching out to everyone who matters across the country in celebrating a mother in a million.


Amosun said that his late mother instilled in him, the virtues of discipline, selflessness, hard work,  loyalty and unwavering commitment to whatever he finds his hands doing.


Reminiscing on his fond memories of his late mother, the frontline stock-broker turned politician said: " If Akeem keeps expanding the frontiers of friendship, give it to my parents". 


"I'm who I'm today by virtues of the pivotal roles of this peace-loving and exceedingly accommodating angel whose doors were perpetually opened to all and sundry. 


"In fact, nothing can be termed too much for me to do in appreciation of her labour of love,  unceasing prayers and the ethos of Omoluabi, the core value of my teeming dedicated foot- soldiers and political allies", he disclosed.


The grand finale of the burial ceremony billed to be anchored by the ace broadcaster and seasoned thespian,  Yemi Sodimu,  will hold at Em Felix Event and Conference Centre, Idi-Aba, Abeokuta, Ogun State, South West, Nigeria.


Expected at the occasion are prominent political gladiators in Ogun State and beyond, former governors and deputy governors.


Others expected guests will include national and state assembly members, state and federal commissioners among others too numerous to mention.
