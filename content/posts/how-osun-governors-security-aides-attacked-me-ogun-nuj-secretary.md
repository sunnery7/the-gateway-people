My name is Bunmi Adigun, and I am the secretary of the Nigeria Union of Journalists NUJ Ogun State Council, I work with the Ogun State Television.



I covered the 66th Birthday and  conferment of chieftaincy title on the governor of Osun State, Senator Ademola Adeleke by Oba Adeyemi Adekeye, AbepaJoga Orile as the Baba Oba.



A colorful event which attracted so many dignatries from with the state and outside but majorly from Osun State maybe.



I was there to cover the event for my station, which was  duly paid for, so if not for this, I have no business, and I won't even near Oke Ata not to talk of Joga Orile.



The governor was amiable, but all the security details were unruly. They started behaving anyhow immediately when their governor arrived, pushing and harassing every journalist, even those who came with other special Guests from Osun State.



They pushed my cameraman and other camera men, thought that was enough until they got to where we were standing, I was harassed, embarrassed, and they nearly tore my cloth. We dragged, as you can see in this video, taken by one of us who disguised.



It was so tough as if it was a campaign gathering, a social gathering it was, and one could imagine how it would have been in Osun State.



I tried to get to those who harassed us, then I noticed they were putting on a different uniform from the normal police uniform we all know, bellaruslike, no name tag, they were on nosemask and holding petal like they were sent to journalists.



I was manhandled and roughened and imagined what will happen to those without tags and any means of identification at an event of such.



Still not feeling fine, but I need to drop this for the world to know how the so called police who are attached to special Nigerians behave at times.
