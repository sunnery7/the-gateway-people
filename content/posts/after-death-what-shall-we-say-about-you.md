It was like a revival or canival of prayers at Stainless Area of  Obantoko, Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital for three  consecutively days when The Apostolic Churches in Abeokuta converged to bid one of their elders farewell. 


The three days programme, comprising service of songs, wake keep and burial service  were conducted and directed by The Apostolic Church, Igbore Area led by Superintendent, Pastor C.O. Aregbesola.
The activities were organised to honour  Elder Timothy Opeoluwa Ayinla-Akemo  for the uncommon life he lived, served and finally rested.


A man of many parts, the late elder covered the Nigerian civil war  as a member of staff of the defunct  Sketch Publishing Company in Ibadan and later joined the Ogun State Ministry of Information where he served  many governors  since 1977 till he retired after a meritorious service in 2000.


Speaking about their late father,  Elder Femi Ayinla, the youngest son of the deceased described him as lovely, caring, faithful, highly transparent when it comes to community works and very strict when it comes to God's works.


According to him, all these virtues have helped the children to be where they are today.
The Obantoko Area prophet, Pastor J.S. Joseph during a short exhortation, highlighted the  good works  of the late elder.


On his own, the Igbore Area Superintendent, Pastor. C.O. Aregbesola urged the congregation to emulate the virtues of the late elder, as well as asked them what they would like people to say about them after death.
He was survived by his wife, Deaconess Alice Ayinla  and children, Elder and Deaconess Tope/ Busola Ayinla, Elder and Deaconess Funso/Lara Sonde, Elder and Deaconess Tunji/Kemi Oduntan, Elder and Deaconess Segun/Funmi Oluwole and Elder and Deaconess Engr. Femi Ayinla.


The burial ceremony climaxed with a thanksgiving service at the Igbore Area Headquarters,  while entertainment of guests took place at OnTech Events Centre  Abiola Way, in the gateway capital.
