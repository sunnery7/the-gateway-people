In a piece commending the relevance of the theme of the annual commemoration this year, one of the notable members of OSIFA, Engr.Ade Omotola noted that it emphasised  the importance of embracing and preserving one's cultural heritage as a means to achieve personal and collective excellence. 



According to him, It suggested that by understanding, appreciating and nurturing the values, traditions, and customs of one's culture, individuals and societies can strengthen their identity and build a foundation for success. 



Said he: "This theme encourages the exploration of the ways in which cultural heritage can inspire innovation, unity, and resilience, ultimately leading to a more prosperous and harmonious future.



Our cultural heritage is a rich tapestry that weaves together the values, traditions, and experiences of our ancestors. It serves as a compass, guiding us through the ever-changing landscape of the modern world. In this era of globalization and rapid technological advancement, it is more important than ever to forge a strong relationship with our cultural strengths, as it paves the way to greatness on both personal and societal levels.



At its core, according to him, culture represents the collective wisdom and identity of a community or a nation. It encapsulates the stories, art, language, and customs that have been passed down from generation to generation. By embracing and celebrating our cultural heritage, we can tap into a wellspring of strength and resilience that can propel us to greatness.



Omotola explained that one of the key aspects of building a strong relationship with our cultural strengths is the preservation of traditions.



He  added that  these time-honored practices, whether they involve music, dance, food, or ceremonies, provide a sense of continuity and belonging..



"They remind us of where we come from and connect us to our roots. When we actively participate in these traditions, we not only keep them alive but also reinforce our cultural identity.



"Moreover, culture acts as a bridge between generations. When grandparents share their stories and experiences with younger family members, they are passing down not only knowledge but also a sense of pride in one's heritage. 



"This intergenerational transmission of culture fosters a deeper understanding of our history and strengthens family bonds. It also allows for a broader perspective, as younger generations can offer fresh insights into how to adapt and evolve these traditions to suit the present.



"In the broader sense, embracing one's cultural strengths can promote unity and tolerance. When we appreciate and respect the cultural diversity that surrounds us, we create a society that is more inclusive and harmonious. 



" Learning about the customs and beliefs of others enables us to find common ground and build connections. This, in turn, can lead to collaborative efforts in solving shared problems and achieving collective goals, which is a hallmark of greatness for any society.



"Building a strong relationship with our cultural strengths also has individual benefits. It provides a sense of identity and purpose. 



"Knowing who we are and where we come from can give us a strong sense of self, which can be a source of motivation and direction in our lives. This, in turn, can lead to personal achievements and successes, as we draw inspiration from the cultural values that have guided our ancestors.



Additionally, cultural strength can be a wellspring of creativity and innovation. When we understand the traditions of our culture, we can find ways to reinterpret and adapt them to create something new and unique. This blend of the old and the new can lead to breakthroughs in art, technology, and various other fields, driving both personal and societal greatness.



In conclusion, building a strong relationship with our cultural strengths is a pathway to greatness on multiple fronts. It reinforces our identity, connects us with our history, fosters unity and tolerance, and fuels personal and collective achievements. Our cultural heritage is not something to be left in the past; it is a well of inspiration and strength that can propel us into a brighter future. 



"By embracing and celebrating our cultural strengths, we can chart a course to greatness that is both fulfilling and meaningful. If we want success, then we should not rely on other people to do what we can also do.

Omo Ogun, Ise ya!
