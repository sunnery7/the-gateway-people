At a book launch to mark the milestone, President Bola Tinubu described Osoba as a  notable Nigerian who is always concerned about the oneness of Nigeria and her development.

Represented by the Vice President, Sen. Kashim Shettima, recalled the leading roles Chief Osoba played as a member of the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) while ensuring that the country returned to democratic rule.



The president, while noting his efforts in co-forming the All Progressives Congress (APC), as a political party, Tinubu added that Osoba’s life would serve as a source of inspiration to the young ones.

While admitting the current economic situation in the country, the president assured that his administration was working to address food shortages.



Senate President, Senator Godswill Akpabio, appreciated the author for putting the book together for the benefit of the next generation.



Secretary to the Federal Government, Sen. George Akume, praised Aremo Osoba as a celebral and highly intelligent man, noting that his views on national and political issues are always cogent, even as he appreciated him for putting his experience in the public service into writing.

Deputy Governor of Lagos State, Dr. Femi Hamzat, who represented Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, noted that Chief Osoba is a prolific writer who is passionate about the development of the country, and called on the upcoming journalists not to de-market the nation but write and comment on issues that would be of benefit to the people.



Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, while recalling the exploit of Chief Osoba in journalism, said  he discovered the bodies of late Prime Minister, Tafawa Balewa and Finance Minister, Chief Festus Okotie-Eboh during the 1966 coup.



"As governor of the gateway state, Aremo Osoba exemplified unwavering dedication, integrity, and a profound commitment to public service".

"His visionary policies in education, healthcare, rural electrification, infrastructure, and agriculture have left an indelible mark on our state’s landscape.



“Chief Osoba’s exceptional drive and penchant for rural development are unprecedented in the history of our State, as he changed the narrative of rural-urban migration during his tenure as Governor by taking development to these communities,” stated Abiodun
