Your Excellency, Chief Olusegun Osoba CFR,



On this monumental occasion of your 86th birthday, I extend my most heartfelt and respectful felicitations to you, sir.



Your life has remained a resounding anthem of patriotism, courage, integrity, and resilience. You are a statesman whose footprints are engraved on the pages of Nigeria’s democratic history, and whose voice echoes in the chronicles of our national media rebirth.



From the frontline of journalism to the commanding heights of political leadership, you have exemplified purpose-driven service and an unwavering commitment to the progress of our dear nation. You are not just a beacon to Ogun State but a national asset whose legacy is not only inspiring but institutionally transformational.



As Akinrogun of Egbaland, your loyalty to the heritage, dignity, and advancement of the Egba people stands as a reference point for all of us who revere our cultural identity and uphold public service with integrity.



On this auspicious birthday, I pray that God Almighty continues to strengthen you with excellent health, renewed wisdom, and divine peace. May your years ahead be filled with joy, fulfillment, and the satisfaction of knowing that you have raised generations of thinkers, leaders, and change-makers.



We celebrate you not only for your age but for the depth, dignity, and durability of your legacy. You are, and shall remain, a father of democracy, a voice of reason, and a compass for responsible leadership. May you continue to flourish and inspire.



Happy birthday, Baba.



With utmost respect and admiration,

Signed:
