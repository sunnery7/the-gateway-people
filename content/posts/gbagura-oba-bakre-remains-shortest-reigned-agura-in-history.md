As lamentations and condolences trailed the transition of the 9th Agura of Gbagura-Abeokuta, Ogun State, Oba Saburee Babajide Isola Bakare on Wednesday,  June 14, 2023, history has shown that the late monarch remains the shortest reigned Agura!



Gbagura is the homestead of the late business mogul, Bashorun Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola, the winner of the historic June 12, 2993 Presidential election. 



Available records show that there were eight Agura of Gbagura before Oba Bakre was presented with the instrument of office by the administration of former Ogun State governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun in May, 2019.



Also, as part of the enthronment, an epoch making coronation celebration held on August 18, 2019 during which sons, daughters and friends of Gbagura celebrated their monarch.



Until his appointment, the late Agura was a Chief Superintendent of Customs and hailed from the Jamolu family of the Egiri Ruling House. 



Located in Abeokuta North Local Government Area of Ogun State, Gbagura is one of the Egba four quarters in Abeokuta.



Aside Gbagura, other Egba quarters in Abeokuta are Ake, Oke-Ona and Owu.



As the paramount ruler of Gbagura,  Agura has no fewer than 72 townships under his control.



The Gbagura people remain the largest Egba entity with vast expanse of land which inter-weaves with other sectional quarters like Ake, Oke-Ona and Owu.



The Agura Chieftaincy Declaration of November 12, 1958, recognises two ruling houses in Gbagura, namely Ajiboso and Egiri.



The Egiri Royal House which produced the immediate past Agura comprises Jamolu, Ijaade, Adeosun, Abolade among other families.



From the Jiboso Royal House are the Sobekuns, whose family trees include the Oyegbatas, Abikanles, Jibua among other families.



Although the declaration specifically stipulated that only a male grandson could ascend the throne; there had been negation of the declaration with the late Agura, Oba Sobekun II, whose father was said to have hailed outside the community.



Also, in the past, there had been another great grandson of Jiboso who was said to have been appointed Agura through his mother’s lineage. 



Oba Bakre's predecessor, the 8th Agura, Oba Halidu Laloko, Sobekun II, joined his ancestors on Thursday July 12, 2018 at age 78 after a 38-year reign.



Laloko’s successor, Oba Raufu Adeosun, reigned from 1961 to 1978. 



So far, Oba Laloko remains the longest reigned Agura, having ascended the throne in 1980, while on the other hands,  Oba Bakre remains the shortest reigned Agura in history.



The first Agura, Oba Jamolu, who hailed from the Egiri Rulimg House was said to have been crowned in 1870 and transited in 1877.



Thereafter, seven Agura were enthroned, namely Oba Ijaade from the Egiri Ruling House, between 1879 and 1897, Oba Olubunmi, from Jiboso ruling house occupied the throne between 1897 to 1910.



Others are Oba Abolade and Oba Adeosun I, both from the Egiri royal house who reigned between 1910 to 1915 and 1915 to 1936 respectively. 



Between 1936 and 1960, Oba Sobekun I, from the Jiboso ruling house was enthroned, while Oba Rauf Adeosun, from the Egiri was coronated in 1961 but joined his ancestors in 1978. He was succeeded by Oba Laloko, the Sobekun II, from the Jiboso royal house.



All things being equalled and with the age long arrangement, the Ajiboso Royal House will eventually produce the next Agura, the 10th in history.
