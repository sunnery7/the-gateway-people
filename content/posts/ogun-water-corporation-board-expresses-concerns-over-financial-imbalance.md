The newly inaugurated board of the Ogun State Water Corporation, led by its Chairman, Hon. Johnson Olu-Fatoki has expressed concerns over the corporation’s financial imbalance
Other board members present at the meeting were Akeran Jimoh, Engr. Femi Oyebanjo, Hon. Gafar Balogun, Hon. Omowunmi Adewale, and Mrs. Ganiyat Abiola Busari.

The board made the observation during its inaugural meeting with the corporation's management at the corporation’s headquarters in Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta.
The management of the corporation was led by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Water Resources, Damilola Otubanjo.
Fatoki, on behalf of the board, also lamented that despite government’s N150 million monthly spending on water provision, the agency only generates about N15 million in revenue.
While describing the situation as unacceptable, the new board vowed to transform the agency into a viable business enterprise as well as improve water supply across the state.
In order to address operational challenges, block revenue leakages, and improve water delivery to all parts of the state, Olu-Fatoki canvassed synergy between the new board and the management 

“We cannot continue like this. The governor has given us a clear mandate to turn things around, and we are ready to hit the ground running,” Olu-Fatoki declared.

He disclosed plans to inspect all water schemes and facilities across the state to assess existing infrastructure and proffer solutions 
To attract investment into the sector as well as enhance technical capacity, the board hinted at exploring the Public-Private Partnership models.

Hon. Otubanjo, who spoke on behalf of the management assured the board of the management’s readiness to collaborate fully in repositioning the agency.

To reduce water wastage and enhance billing efficiency, Otubanjo revealed that plans were underway to install prepaid meters for all customers.
She attrubuted water supply challenges in the state to the destruction of pipelines by construction firms during road expansion projects.
This development she noted had hampered water distribution in several areas of the state.
