"It is now time for us all to jettison our differences and come together and work as one family  to move our community forwards"



"I want to say unequivocally that today's occassion is not about me, your new Kabiyesi, the Olu of Orile Imo, legitimately elected, authoritatively approved and publicly presented and installed"



"Rather, it is about the actualization of the dream of the progressive sons and daughters of Orile Imo to make the land of our birth into a place of pride in Ogun State.



"It is about the future of our children in their different cadres; it is about purposeful leadership that will take our community to the next level and guarantee a glorious future for all our children.

"It's almost five years ago that the Obaship tussle began but we thank God that it has ended with the public installation and coronation of Oba Sogaolu, the popular choice of many natives of Orile Imo and indeed Imo".



"Oba Sogaolu is a man of the people who does not only like his community, but his people with whom he had shared his personal endowments and resources in the past".



"We are happy with his choice as our king. He derserves it. Long before he showed interest in being our monarch, he has done many things for the community as well as its people. The Oba is among our illustrious sons in whom we are very pleased".
