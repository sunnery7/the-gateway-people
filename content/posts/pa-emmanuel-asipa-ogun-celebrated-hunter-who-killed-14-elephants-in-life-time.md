Today in Iwoye-Ketu, a boarder community in Imeko Afon Local Government Area of Ogun State, children, family members, relations and others will gather to celebrate the life and times of the late Pa Emmanuel Alao Asipa.


A famous farmer and great hunter of his time, who died at age 120, Pa Asipa will for long be remembered by his natives, contemporaries and others for his hunting escapades which led to his killing 14 elephants in his younger hunting years!


This rare feat by no one else in the community earned the late centenarian the title of Jagunde of Iwoye-Ketu and its surrounding communities.


The late great hunter was among other children, the father of the former Chairman of Imeko/Afon Local Government Area of the state, and now National President, Association of  Ex-Local Government Chairmen of Nigeria (ASELGON), Hon Albert Durojaiye Asipa.
Speaking about his life as a hunter, the Jagunde said he was initiated into the hunting rites by his father at age 18.
" I started accompanying my father to the forest early in life, because it was the practice then for the son of a hunter to be initiated into the hunting culture". 


"When I grew up and had my independence,  particularly after my father's death, I killed many wild animals  including leopards, antelopes and even elephants. As a young hunter, I killed as many as 14 elephants before my late uncle advised me to stop hunting". 


" It was generally believed that if I continued with the fame that was usually associated with the killing of elephants,  my life might be cut short. Before I stopped hunting, I was honoured with the title of  Asipa and later with the highest hunting title, Jagunde by the Iwoye community and other communities nearby".
The Jagunde said it was suicidal for any hunter not to fortify himself with assorted  charms and amulets when going on hunting expedition.


"In my hunting years, I was more or else a warlord with many people fearing me because of my accessibility to many  spiritual medicines and other charms. 


"Sincerely speaking, I did not use the spiritual medicines and charms to the detriment of people in my life. In the past, I traversed many places in Nigeria, consulting for people on their traditional and spiritual needs" the Jagunde revealed.


How would the Jagunde like to be remembered?. " I want to be remembered as the great hunter of Iwoye-Ketu, the man who prefers to do good to his fellow human beings in spite of his access to and understanding and mastery of the use of assorted herbs and roots".


"As  a farmer and hunter, I have assisted a lot of people who sought my help in one way or the other. My philosophy in life is do no harm to your fellow human beings".


"I'm of the opinion that whatever you do to your fellow humanbeings is kept in the cooler for you till the future  when you must have forgotten that you once harmed anyone and you would be visited by repercussions". 
Until his passage, the Jagunde was the custodian of the Ogere, a traditional drum that is beaten to announce the passage of a hunter.


Before his death on Tuesday,  July 19, 2016,  he was arguably one of the oldest persons in the state whom the past government celebrated.


Although he did not know the year he was born, but Pa Asipa during this interview conducted months before his death, said he couldn't be younger than 116.


He said he was not a day younger than 40 at the commencement of "Hitler's War", the Second World War which broke out in September 1939 and lasted till 1945.
According to him, he was a constabulary in the police for about a year shortly before he married his late first wife, Durorike.


Until his death, Pa Asipa was married to three wives, who had for him,  eight children. Durorike, his late first wife who died in 2006 had for him five children. Helen and Salimotu were his second and last wife respectively. They also had children for him too.
"Unfortunately for me, two of my wives have died, while many of my children have died too. The last born of my first wife's children was Joel.


"It's God's doing that I have outlived all my age-mates, my siblings, wives and even many children and grandchildren. I did not like it this way as I had always prayed that they survived me during my old age. But who am I to question God for the turn of events".


His first born was Mrs. Elizabeth Adejobi, while the youngest child of his five children from his first wife was over 70 years of age before he died.


The last born of his parents, Pa Asipa, in his life time, said he was usually the most sought after witness in land cases involving Iwoye -Ketu and its neighbours.


The late Ooye of Iwoye-Ketu, Oba Joel Ademola Alaye, who was present during the interview quickly corroborated Pa Asipa's claim " Baba is a rare human, he's a father to us all".
Aside his hunting feat that brought fame for the late centurarian, Iwoye-Ketu, is also an historic border town associated with  mystical tales and taboos.


Prominent among this is that it is a taboo for anyone or group to use umbrella or rear pigs.
Orisa Oluwa, a Yoruba deity, which is greatly celebrated and worshipped in the town forbids the use of umbrella as well as rearing of pigs


The town, reputed to have more Fulanis who co-habit peacefully with their host community than any Yoruba town, has also produced two Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland.


The first Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Kokorogangan and Oyatope were said to have hailed from the town that has also produced many great warriors.


Aside the blazing trail of Aare Onakakanfo,  Iwoye is said to be the home of many warlords who in their days saved the Yoruba nation from  external aggressors.
