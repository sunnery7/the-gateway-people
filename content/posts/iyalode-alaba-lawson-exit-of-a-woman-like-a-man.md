Longevity is good but not how long but how well one lived on earth. What Iyalode achieved at 72 may be worthy of note than what some achieved at 92. She rose early in life. She has become so prominent in her 20’s. I have been reading and hearing about Iyalode for about 40 years now.



My prayer is that God will comfort the Lawson’s/Jiboku’ s family, the Egba Kingdom and Yorubaland. Her Legacy and passion for Quality Education is well-known all-over Ogun State and Nigeria. I worked with her at various levels at IOD formation in Ogun State and also as her financial consultant at a time, and I can say that Iyalode is known for her firm stand for integrity, justice and fairness. SHE WAS A STRONG WOMAN LIKE A MAN. She does not take no for an answer. Iyalode will go to any length with you if she likes you and agrees with you.



I recalled in April 2016 that Iyalode was with us at Ajebo during my mother’s Christian wake keep by the Deeper Life Bible church till 9 pm. We decided that all burial activities then would be in the village, she said, if you like go to Ogunmakin or Alapako; I must be there with you.



She will stand with you to any length once you are on the same page. One time I had a meeting with her, Prof Osibanjo, Dr. Laolu and Dupe Lawson at Ibadan; I discovered from that day, that Iyalode loves her children so much that she was ready to take any risk for them. She can go to any length to make them comfortable.



She was a fearless woman. The mother of all market women. Always willing to serve. Iyalode and I use to discuss how she was mentored by late Chief Adeyemi Lawson. Her voice…rings in my ears…”Dr. Adeoye…Ani lati rira, oro wa oooo”..meaning we need to see because we have matters to discuss.



If you do anything to Iyalode and she is happy with you; she will tell the whole world about you. I recall how she told Mrs Tejuoso some things I did for her just in my normal professional capacity. At another time; I saw Baba Adewolu in my office. He said Gbenga …Iyalode has told me all you did. I was so shocked. I later asked her “Iyalode, why are you telling everybody. She said; Koda, ma so fun Gomina wa paapa…meaning I will even tell the governor.



On the other hand, Let God catch you and you do wrong…Then you are in trouble. One day, someone was trying to take something that belongs to the Lawsons and I was with her in her house, she said, you people better tell them to stop now because "eni to gbe adie otosi, ogbe talaroye". I will report them to the women in the land.  She was that woman that anyone who desire to be a governor in our state must visit and seek her support.



Iyalode can be described by those who see her afar off as very stubborn but the truth is that, if she believes in anything, you cannot easily change her to switch. She was not an hypocrite. If she does not agree with you no matter who you are, she will tell you to your face. Iya awon Obinrin Ile Yoruba lo (The mother of Yoruba women is gone.)



May the Lord comfort all the family. My friends…Baba Tim…( Timmy Lawson), Dr. Laolu Lawson and. his wife..(Dupe Lawson)…I must remember OreOluwa…Baby of the house.  Akin Lawson who broke the news to the whole world…I pray for the comfort of the holy spirit for you and in deed all the children. May God comfort you all. All her children have one thing in common and that is humility.



Her memory is all over the places. Alaba Lawson Group of Schools is an example of a legacy not to be forgotten in Ogun State and Nigeria as the school has produced world class scholars leading at various levels. To get a replacement for Iyalode in Egbaland and in Yorubaland is a very big task for us. We Pray that after her death; the family will be more united, healthy and under the wings and shadow of the almighty God in Jesus name. Amen



Adieu Iyalode.
