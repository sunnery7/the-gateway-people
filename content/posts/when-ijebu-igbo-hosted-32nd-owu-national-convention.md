It was an assemblage of eminent  Owu sons and daughters as well as their traditional rulers as the 32nd Owu National Convention held.



The 2-day event with the theme: "The Year of  Consolidation", held in Ijebu Igbo, headquarters of Ijebu North Local Government Area of Ogun State.



An illustrious Owu son, Senator Lekan Mustapha, CON was the special host with Alhaji (Chief) S.A. Maiyegun co-hosting.



After formalties of arrival of delegates and other programmes, on Friday  December 15  2023, Obas/ National Executive Council Meeting and gala night held at St. John's Catholic Primary School  Ground.



On Saturday, December 16  2023, the convention day proper, a thanksgiving church service held at St. John's Anglican Church(Olokuta) Oke Sopen area of the Orimolusi ancient town.



The service was attended by Owu Obas and Baales, their chiefs and  others from Abeokuta, Ogun, Oyo, Osun, Kwara and  Lagos states.



During the service, the Vicar/Archdeacon of  Saint John's Anglican Church, Ijebu-Igbo, Venerable Lawrence Otegbola urged Owu people to live in harmony not only with their kinsmen and women, but with their neighbours irrespective of their tribes.



He also charged Owu traditional rulers to champion the crusade for unity among themselves as well as with others.



In particular, he urged  Owu people to see their diversity as major advantage capable to transforming the economy of the people and ensuring peaceful co-existence with others.



Otegbola also wants eminent sons and daughters of Owu-Kingdom to  champion the crusade for unity among Owu-people



Reading from Psalm 133 of the Holy Bible, he charged  those in position of authorities to use such key positions to support others and lift them up.



This is to reduce the alarming rate of poverty as well as insecurity in the country. 



"We should use our key positions to support people around us for the progress of the society, we should strive to make others to grow and reduce level of poverty in the land.



 "Your greatest achievements in life is raising people to become greater. Don't allow anyone to discourage you from making people great", 



"Support the education of other people as well as other family members and not your own family members alone. Lift up other people who are not members of your immediate families and see your growth rising astronomically"



"To invest in property is good, but investing in people is better. Your greatest achievement in life is raising people and not your wealth.



"There are many benefits in brethren dwelling in unity and harmony. When we want unitu in Nigetia, we must not discriminate among our diverse tribes".



According to him, the last general election would have been more interesting if the Peoples Democratic Party had agreed that it was the turn of the Southwest to produce the president from the party.



The priest, who expressed concerns over what he described as gradual extinction of the Yoruba language, urged sons and daughters to save culture and traditions of the race from dieing



He lamented that the current generation of Yoruba children and youth no longer understand as well as speak the language.



To appreciate the beauty of rich tradition and cultural values of Yoruba, he stressed the need for parents to begin to encourage the speaking of the language in their various homes among  their children.



According to him, speaking and understanding the language would preserve it and save it from going into extinction.



Otegbola said cultural celebration like Owu National Convention, should always be used to project the rich moral values of Yorubas.



Similarly in his speech at the grand-finale of the convention,  National President of Royal Union of Owu People (RUOP), Engr. Fatai Akinbade, described the situation as unfortunate lamenting that the language is gradually being replaced with foreign languages.



"It's equally a sad commentary that while our language is being replaced with foreign languages, especially the English language, our culture and traditions have been submerged by civilization. 



"Most parents today do not know their family Oriki (panegyrics), let alone their children who have completely gone foreign. This must definitely change through a systemic rebirth if we don't want to lose it all in the nearest future", he stated. 



Also speaking as special host, Sen. Lekan Mustapha said  "all hands must be on deck to foster unity not only within Owu people but among our neighbours in the spirit of the theme of this year's convention "The Year of Consolidation"



"The need to consolidate the legacies of our forefathers is now. Progress and development of Owu nation and by extension Nigeria as a whole should be the concern of all of us ".



He also appealed to them to donate generously towards the completion of the ongoing National Secretariat  project of Owu-Nation in Orile-Owu, Osun State.



Former President Olusegun Obasanjo was represented by wife, Bola who joined other prominent sons and daughters of Owu-kingdom including the Oganla of Owu-Abeokuta and National Secretary of Royal Union of Owu People, Hon. Johson Olu- Fatoki and Elder Wole Oyelese among others.

Maiyegun  for their contributions to various Owu communities across the country as well as empowerment of some selected women in various trades by Obirin-Owu.



The event was spiced-up with rich display  of variety of cultural dance.



President of ROUP, Engr. Fatai Akinbade while going down memory lane,  said since the formation of the group 32years ago,  the union had been experiencing continuous unity and progress.



This Akinbade said had been ROUP's hallmark, adding that "more Owu settlements have joined and the union is waxing stronger in the unity and progress "



Akinbade, commended the efforts of Nigeria's  former president and Balogun of Owu-Abeokuta, Olusegun Obasanjo for encouragement given so far.



He called on sons and daughters of Owu-kingdom to consolidate on the achievements of the group by ensuring completion of the national secretariat project.
