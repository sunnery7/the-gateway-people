Ibadan has lost a giant, but heaven has gained a conqueror. Our Kabiyesi, Oba Owolabi Akinloye Olakulehin, Ige-Olakulehin I, has completed his race and fulfilled his destiny. 


Today, we do not mourn like those without understanding. We celebrate a life lived on his own terms, a journey of boldness, tradition, and ultimate victory.


In the weeks leading to his 90th birthday and first anniversary on the ancient throne of Ibadan, we began compiling stories for a commemorative book about his life.
That book, I tell you, is not just ink on paper, it is a window into the fascinating life of a man who defied odds, silenced doubters, and stood tall in the proud lineage of Ibadan warriors.


As we reached out to some of his old friends, their stories left me in awe. They recalled how Baba, in his youthful confidence, would tap his tribal marks and tease them, calling them "bastards" because they had no tribal marks to trace their heritage. With a proud, knowing laugh, he would boldly declare that one day, they would all prostrate before him as their Olubadan. Many laughed, few believed, but destiny listens to no one’s laughter. Destiny speaks last.


There was even the account of one of them who, in those playful days, would tap him on the head saying, “Olubadan ko, Olubadan ni?” Sadly, that friend did not live to witness the prophecy fulfilled, he passed away just two years before Baba was crowned.


But indeed, the day came. He sat on the throne of his forefathers, the 43rd Olubadan of Ibadanland, carrying the crown with quiet strength and dignity.
 His journey teaches us all that destiny may take its time, but it never forgets. The queue may be long, but when your time comes, no force can stop it.


Kabiyesi came, he saw, and he conquered. His reign, though brief, was crowned with dignity and sealed with the pride of Ibadan. His name is etched into our history, his legacy forever tied to this ancient city where rusted roofs tell stories and warriors are born.


A conqueror has gone home, but the echoes of his victory will never fade.
Sleep well, Kabiyesi. Ibadan remembers. Ibadan salutes you.


Sun re o, Kabiyesi.
