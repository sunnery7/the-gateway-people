It was an historic day in Akinale, an Owu town in Ewekoro Local Government Area of Ogun State as Oba Adediran Oluseyi was crowned the 2nd Towulade of the town.


The first and last Towulade of the community was the late veteran journalist, publisher, Public Relations impresairo and erudite lawyer, Dr. Olufemi Ogunleye, who on June 19, 2024 joined his ancestors. 


The Olowu of Owu Kingdom,  Oba (Prof.) Saka Matemilola, Otileta VI crowned Oba Adediran Oluseyi, who on July 7 was presented with staff of office and instrument of appointment by the Ogun State government.
The coronation ceremony which held at the Olowu Palace, Abeokuta was filled with cultural splendour and displays as well as traditional prayers.


Oba Matemilola charged the new Towulade to embrace peace, unity and visible development in Akinale.
He said: “This throne is a sacred trust. I charge you to rule with fairness, promote harmony and ensure that Akinale continues to grow in peace and progress.” 

 Oba Oluseyi, while responding, expressed gratitude to God, the Olowu, and the people of Akinale for the honour bestowed on him.


“This is a call to service. I will work tirelessly to promote unity, peace, and development for the good of Akinale and Owu Kingdom at large,” he said.
The community was founded by the legendary hunter and warrior,  Odetoyinbo Akanni Lapeleke and his two siblings. 


The siblings are Majeogbe and Akinwale,  circa 1836 through 1840 which shortly made Akinale became the epic -centre of the Owu Peace Keeping Militia, (OPKM).


The OPKM was headed by Lapeleke and  supported by his compatriots who included Jogunomi, Ojukotimi, Akindele, Gbaalefa, Awayesonlu and Sangojinmi Gudugba among other vibrant hunters.


The legends were said to be arrow heads of Owu Militia in the Egba Allied Forces that liberated Abeokuta from the interloping Dahomeyans amazon of the war century.
