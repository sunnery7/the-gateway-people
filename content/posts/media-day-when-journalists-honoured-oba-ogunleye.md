Akinale, an Owu settlement, along Lagos/Abeokuta Road, in Ewekoro Local Government Area of Ogun State, played host to journalists, Public Relations practitioners and Advertising personnel within and outside the state, the way it has never done on  Monday, September 23, 2024.



The occassion was the "Media Day for Oba Olufemi Ogunleye", the late Towulade of Akinale, who joined his ancestors on June 19, 2024 in the United Kingdom after a brief illness.



The event was put together by a group of journalists, PR practitioners and Advertising gurus (Under a Media Committe) drawn from within and outside the state.



The committee was driven by a task force which ensured that the ceremony, which idea was mooted within a matter of days did not fail.



The Media Day which kick-started the 4-day funeral activities, fell on the 80th posthumous birthday of the late veteran journalist and PR impresario.



Welcoming dignitaries, Chairman, Central Planning Committee of the passage of Oba Ogunleye, Dr. Kola Adesina extolled the virtues of the late Ogun monarch noting that he was worthy of being celebrated.



Adesina, who is currently Head of Department of Crescent University, Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital thanked every one for finding time to be in attendance.



He told the gathering that the late traditional ruler would have marked his 80th birthday on the very day, (Monday, September, 23) but for death that changed the tide of things.



His words: "what we were preparing for was his 80th  birthday until death sneaked in like a thief  in the night.  We have made necessary arrangements  towards this. But as God would have it, things changed and this is what we are having today. 



"Who are we to query God?", Dr. Adesina, a close confidant of the late Oba Ogunleye  asked rhetorically.



According to him, the late Oba liked to call himself a reporter, "but to me, he was a reporter of reporters. A chief reporter, who has trained many reporters"



"Aside the "Iwe Irohin Fun Awon Egba ati Agbegbe re" which was published in 1859, the first time anyone would attempt any newspaper publishing in Nigeria was through the late Oba Ogunleye".



"At that time, he was  Public Relations officer at the Nigeria Airways. Although, he had no money, but he had passion for training young journalists in the arts of writing/ reporting



"I'm bold to tell this gathering that I'm a product of what the late journalism icon stood for not only as a reporter with the "The Village News", but later in 1985 as the editor of the pioneer post-Nigeria Independence community newsreel in the country".



"I was not alone with the "The Village News" back then. The likes of the current Olota of Ota, Oba (Prof.) Abdul Kadir Obalanlege, Dr. Sina Aina, former HOD, Mass Communication, Moshood Abiola Polytechnic, ,MAPOLY, Dr. Goke Rauf, Rector, D.S. Adegbenro ICT Polytechnic and  Mr. Femi Dokunmu, who retired as Public Relations Manager, Ogun-Osun Rivers Basin Development Authority among others received their initial journalism training from  "The Village News"



"As a member of staff of the Nigeria Airways, the late Oba Ogunleye could not use his real names, so we called him "Olufemi Iyanda Omo Bale" as the editor-in-chief of the "The Village News"



In his tribute, former Ogun State Commissioner for Information, Chief (Dr.) Fassy Yusuf, described the late Kabiyesi as a friend, brother colleague in Public Relations and senior colleague in journalism. 



"It is sad and incredible that Oba Ogunleye has departed this world to be with his creator. We will all miss him".he said



Going down memory lane, Dr. Yusuf said: " Our path crossed when the late Oba was at the Nigeria Airways and I was at Rod Publicity, Lagos. We have many things in common; particularly our passion for education and excellence.  I remember when I was in the UK, he was always there for me, giving me free tickets to the UK and the US. One thing you can't take away from him was his humility and his passion for community service.



"He has gone to rest with his creator. The angels will be singing his praises as we here that he left behind will be lamenting his death as well as melancholise his passage. But who are we to challenge God for his passage. We shall miss Kabiyesi and I will personally continue to cherish Oba Ogunleye", the Ijebu-born veteran journalist and PR icon stated.



Chairman of the ceremony, Dr. Niran Malaolu, who extolled the virtues of the late monarch said a man who lived in the hearts of men do not usually die.



"For Oba Ogunleye, he did not die, he is very much alive. Kabiyesi o ku o. We're not mourning, but celebrating him as he lives in our hearts. Kabiyesi, as a reputable journalist and PR man was a fantastic one who for long would be remembered. Oba Ogunleye was a man of value. What is the meaning and worth of a man that lacks value in life?".
