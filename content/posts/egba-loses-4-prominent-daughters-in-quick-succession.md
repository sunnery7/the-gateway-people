While their relations, family members and others were still mourning and lamenting their deaths, the news of the passage of Chief(Alhaja) Fausat Adeola Oke, proprietress of Madojutimi Food Canteen also rocked the state capital.
The popular restaurateur, who once made waves at the Oke Ilewo Area of the town died at age 77 after a brief illness.


Prominent Nigerians within and outside the state attended their funerals and 8th-day Fridau ceremonies which held at different social centres in the state capital.
The 8th-day prayers and social events held at the Abeokuta Sports Club for the late "Cash Madam" and Alhaja Bankole respectively.


The ONTEC Hall, along Abiola Way, in the ancient town was the venue for the  Fridau of Alhaja Madojutimi, with many members of Ansar-Ud-Deen Society  in attendance.
