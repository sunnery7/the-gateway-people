The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has warned candidates against the misuse of their National Identification Numbers.
The warning was contained in a weekly bulletin released on the board’s website on Monday.
This is ahead of the commencement of registration for the 2026 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination.

The Registrar of the board, Prof. Is-haq Oloyede, issued the warning during an interactive meeting with JAMB management in preparation for the sales of application forms and registration for the 2026 UTME and Direct Entry examinations.
Oloyede cautioned against multiple or double registrations, as well as the use of multiple National Identification Numbers by a single candidate for purposes such as impersonation or identity manipulation, are strictly prohibited and will attract severe sanctions.

He also warned candidates against examination malpractices including impersonation, extortion, image blending, group registration, inappropriate movement of routers, donating fingerprints, and other irregularities.
While reaffirming JAMB’s commitment to a cashless registration system, Oloyede added that the cost of Direct Entry application documents remains ₦5,700, UTME without Mock is ₦7,200, while UTME with Mock is ₦8,700.
Oloyede also stated that Direct Entry registration and e-PIN vending will begin on March 2 and end on April 25, 2026 adding that Direct Entry registration will be conducted exclusively at JAMB offices.
He added that UTME candidates would register before Direct Entry candidates, noting that the sale of UTME application documents, beginning with the creation of candidate profiles, will commence on January 19 and end on February 26, 2026.

According to Oloyede, the actual UTME registration period will run from January 26 to February 28, 2026, at all approved CBT centres, while the deadline for Mock selection is February 16, 2026.
