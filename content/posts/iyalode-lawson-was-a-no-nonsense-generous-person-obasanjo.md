Former President, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo has described the late Iyalode of Egbaland and Yorubaland, Chief Mrs Alaba Lawson MFR, as a woman who lived a worthwhile life as well as being a very generous personality. 



Lawson was the founder of the popular Alaba Lawson Group of Schools and has been assisting some indigent pupils on scholarships in the school.



In a release by his Special Assistant on Media, Kehinde Akinyemi on Saturday,  Obasanjo said the late educationist and industrialist contributed immensely to the development of Nigeria in general. 



"Iyalode Lawson lived a worthwhile life and she did well in life. I knew she has been down, but, I don't really know the cause. 



"She was a fantastic human being and she was no nonsense person, hardworking and a very generous personality. I will miss her sorely," Obasanjo was quoted as having said. 



For her contributions to the economic growth of the country and community development, Obasanjo as Nigerian president in 2004, honoured the late educationist and industrialist with Member of the Order of Federal Republic (MFR).



After initial rejection by her late mother, she was eventually installed with the title of Iyalode of Egbaland in August, 1999 and later came the Iyalode Yorubaland in August, 2008.
