The Ogun State Council of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), has suspended the Chairperson and the Financial Secretary of the Nigeria Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ) in the state.
Comrades Sekinat Salam and Charity James were suspended over allegations of fraud and misconduct.
The suspension was announced on Thursday at the end of the NUJ monthly congress held at the Iwe Iroyin Press Centre, Abeokuta.

According to the communiqué issued after the congress, the decision followed the consideration of a report submitted by the Council’s Ethics and Disciplinary Committee on allegations surrounding the opening of a bank account in the name of NUJ by some NAWOJ executive members.

Consequently, Congress resolved that the NAWOJ chairperson and financial secretary be suspended with immediate effect, pending the outcome of a fresh investigation to be conducted by the newly inaugurated Ethics and Disciplinary Committee.

The suspension is connected to an internal crisis within the Nigeria Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ), Ogun State Chapter, following allegations of financial impropriety involving the opening of a bank account purportedly in the name of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ).

The Nigeria Association of Women Journalists is an affiliate association under the umbrella of the Nigeria Union of Journalists.

The matter was first brought before the Ogun NUJ through allegations that some NAWOJ executive members were involved in the use of a cheque issued in the name of NAWOJ to open an account bearing the NUJ name, an action viewed as a serious breach of union procedures and financial regulations.

An initial investigation was carried out by the NUJ Ethics and Disciplinary Committee, a report of which was read during Thursday’s Congress.

The congress further directed the NAWOJ Vice Chairperson, Comrade Toyin Adegoke to take full charge of the affairs of the association during the period of suspension. 

The Acting Chairperson, was also mandated to commence the process of conducting a bye-election to fill the vacant position of treasurer within two weeks.

Similarly, congress directed that the council leadership and all affected chapels immediately commence preparations for bye-elections to fill existing vacancies within the next two weeks. 

Key positions to be filled include the Council treasurer, as well as chapels’ leadership roles such as chairman and secretary of the Correspondents’ Chapel, treasurer of the Federated Chapel, and secretary of the NTA Chapel.
