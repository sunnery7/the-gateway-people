As he continues to fumble, grubble and wobble through the demands of his exalted position, Senate President, Godswill Akpabio, has moved from many uncommon blunders to uncommon scandals.

 

He caught a pitiful picture within the first week of his assumption of office as number three citizen with a reckless and annoying gaffe which sent shock waves across the nation. 



When a small man assumes a big position, one of two things is likely to happen either he rises to the challenge of his position or reduces the position to his level.



Akpabio was at his ridiculous best when last Saturday at a function in Ilaro, Ogun State, he descended from his Olympian heights to fan the embers of ethnic bigotry, as he openly canvassed support for Senator Solomon Olamilekan Adeola’s (a.k.a YAYI) ambition to be the next governor of Ogun State. 



By so doing, he has continued to demonstrate his lack of proper grasp of the presidential system of government, Nigeria is presently operating.



 This demands the cessation of all politicking at the end of every election to focus on governance. 



By continuing partisan politicking in the face of the monumental problems facing the nation, Akpabio is demonstrating gross indifference to the socio – economic problems that Nigerians at all levels are facing and which the administration of Akpabio is assumed to be a prominent member is having sleepless nights to confront.



He has demonstrated an unimaginable incompetence so far. Presently, he is moving from pillar to pole to stop attempts by more serious elements within the Senate to retire him permanently to the floor where he rightly belongs.



He should either resign his position to take up a more appropriate job as the campaign manager/lackey of the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriation or shape up to the demands of the office.
