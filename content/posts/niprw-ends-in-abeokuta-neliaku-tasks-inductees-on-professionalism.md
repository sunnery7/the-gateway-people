The national president spoke shortly after the induction and oath administration on new members of the institute.



They included  conferment of ordinary,  associate and fellow membership as well as honorary fellowship on outstanding Nigerians.



“We have heard many reports that most government and political office holders appoint non professional PR person to manage their information.



"Instead of them to get the professional to it, they use quack, when in problem then look for professionals to mitigate their problems”



“May I inform you that we are working on modalities to ensure that such unprofessional conduct will stop soon, as we are not going to allow them to use us to correct their mistake again.”



He disclosed that the institute was embarking on several projects which include NIPR School, NIPR Young Youth Hub, Digital Centre and the university among others.



The president appreciated Nasarawa State governor, Engr. Abdullahi Sule for providing the institute with large hectares of land to build the finishing school in the state.



He also disclosed that Nasarawa State governor has provided 10 million fund to start the finishing school.



The NIPR boss appreciated Ogun state Governor for also supporting the institute with the sum of 10 million Naira towards  hosting the first NIPR week in the state.



Neliaku urged other state governors to key into the new phase of the NIPPR Agenda.



Meanwhile, Ogun State government has redeemed its pledge of giving the institute a vehicle and an office.



The donation came barely three hours after Governor Abiodun's investiture as patron of the institute.



While pledging maximum support of his administration, Abiodun also promised to deliver the keys to an office for the institute within the next three weeks.



Neliaku, while appreciating the kind gesture of the governor who had earlier in the week played host to the institute in his office described him as a “talk and do” governor.



He recalled that many governors had made unfulfilled promises, but Governor Abiodun had beaten the expectations of many NIPR practitioners for his hospitality, gifts and contributions to the success of the maiden conference in the state.



“Before we came to Ogun State, we have heard that governor Dapo Abiodun is a “talk and do” and man who always back his words with action, i appreciate his efforts for the success of this conference and supporting for PR professional practice in his state.



“I called on the state chapter of NIPR to ensure that they justify the privilege bestowed on them by the governor saying "to whom much is given, more is expected.”



Dr. Neliaku called on others governors in Nigeria to emulate the supporting spirits of Ogun and Nasarawa state governors, stressing that both governors have shown goodwill and support for the development of NIPR and PR practice in their states.
