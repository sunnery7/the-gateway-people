As Nigeria prepares to lay to rest one of its most illustrious sons, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, on May 3, 2025, the nation mourns not just a man but an institution—an unwavering symbol of integrity, justice, and relentless advocacy for true federalism. 

At 96, Baba Adebanjo departed this world, leaving behind a legacy that will continue to inspire generations.

A Life of Uncompromising Principles

Pa Adebanjo was a rare breed—a man whose public convictions were perfectly mirrored in his private life. From his early days as a Zikist to his evolution into one of Obafemi Awolowo’s most steadfast disciples, he remained resolute in his beliefs. 

Unlike many of his contemporaries who wavered under political pressure, Adebanjo stood firm, even when it meant standing alone.

His life was a testament to the power of consistency. Whether advocating for restructuring, condemning military rule, or championing the rights of the marginalized, he never shied away from speaking truth to power. His courage was legendary—imprisoned several times, harassed by successive governments, yet never silenced.

A Personal Honour: The Lecture That Defined My 50th Birthday

Among the many privileges I had in knowing Baba Adebanjo, one stands out as a defining moment in my life—his acceptance to deliver the lecture at my 50th birthday celebration on July 8, 2012. For a man of his stature to honour me in such a manner was not just a personal milestone but a validation of the values we both held dear.

That day, he spoke with his characteristic passion—on Nigeria’s political failures, the betrayal of Awolowo’s ideals, and the urgent need for restructuring. His words were not just a birthday gift to me but a clarion call to all present: "We must never sacrifice principles for temporary gains." That lecture remains etched in my memory, a reminder of the kind of leader he was—one who gave of himself freely in the service of truth.

The Advocate Who Never Retired

Even in his 90s, Adebanjo remained a digital sage—dispensing wisdom via WhatsApp, engaging with younger activists, and writing fiery press statements. His support for Peter Obi in the 2023 elections was not a departure from his principles but a reinforcement of them. He believed in equity—that after decades of northern and southern presidencies, it was only just for the Southeast to produce a leader. Many criticized him, but he stood his ground, proving once again that for him, justice was not negotiable.

The Sorrow of a Patriot

Yet, beneath his fiery exterior was a man burdened by Nigeria’s unfulfilled potential. He often lamented the selfishness of the political class, the abandonment of Awolowo’s welfarist ideals, and the reluctance to restructure the country. His greatest sorrow was that he might not live to see the Nigeria of his dreams—a nation built on equity, fairness, and true federalism.

How Do We Honour Him?

As we bid farewell to this titan, the question arises: How best can we immortalize Ayo Adebanjo?

Renaming monuments after him is fitting, but the greatest tribute would be to realize the Nigeria he fought for—a restructured nation where no region dominates another, where justice is not a privilege but a right. The best way to honour him is to continue his struggle, to demand accountability, and to uphold the principles he lived and died for.

Final Farewell to a Father and Mentor

Baba Adebanjo was more than a leader; he was a mentor, a father figure, and a moral compass. His absence leaves a void, but his life offers a blueprint. As he is laid to rest, we take solace in knowing that his legacy will endure—not in stone or bronze, but in the ideals he instilled in us.

Rest well, Baba. Your fight was noble, your life was impactful, and your memory will forever be a beacon for those who believe in a just and equitable Nigeria.

Adieu, Baba rere - the true Afenifere!
