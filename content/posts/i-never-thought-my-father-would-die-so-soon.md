Death is usually an unwelcome visitor which usually knocks at the door of its victim at a time when it was least expected or  wanted!



Even when the circumstances of such a death is associated with terminal ailment which suggests that it may eventually lead to death, no one willingly welcomes death when it comes as it must come in one's life.



So it was for the father of a gentle, humble Police Inspector, Omosowon Akinwale, who last Saturday lost his aged dear father, Pa Israel Alamu Omosowon to the cold hands of death at age 75.



At Imashai, Yewa North Local Government Area of Ogun State, where the Septuagenarian died but buried on Sunday, family members, friends and relatives of Omosowon paid their last respect to the late community man.



Inspector Omosowon, who played host to mourners from within and outside the state betrayed emotion during the funeral service lamenting the passage of his father.



According to him, he never thought he would become fatherless so soon, disclosing that he became motherless at a younger age.



"My father's death came as a surprise. I never thought the old man would depart us so soon. However, we  thank God for the humble and pious life that he lived".



"He was not only a devout Christian, but a community man whose desire while on this side of planet was always  to improve and better the lots of mankind. I will miss him greatly".



"I grew up to know him as both my father and mother having lost my mother at a younger age with the dual huge responsibilities of parenthood falling on him alone"



Although his late father later re-married, the young police officer remains the first son of the family with many half brothers and sisters who survived the old man.



Before he re-settled in Abule Maria-Imasai, Omosowon said his late father had lived and worked in Lagos for many years during which he stayed with him.



"After we lost our mother, the responsibilities of taking care of me and my sibling fell on my late father who literarily became our cook and on many occassions washed our clothes for us. May his soul rest in perfect peace".



"On his return to Imasai, he engaged in other activities in addition to becoming a big time farmer, specialising in both food and cash crops until nature took its toll on him".



Speaking on the lessons of life his late father taught him, Omosowon, fondly called "OC" said: "he was an embodiment of humility, fatherhood and friendliness among others which I strive to emulate"



"He also taught me how to relate with people irrespective of one's status or position in life. This is in addition to making God one's bedrock in life through fervent prayers".



"Aside being a father, he was also a confidant and mentor. I will miss him greatly for the rest of my life" he said while holding back tears.
