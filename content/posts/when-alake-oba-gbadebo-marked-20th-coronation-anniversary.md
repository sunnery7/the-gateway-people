The memories of the 20th coronation anniversary of the Alake and paramount ruler of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Aremu Gbadebo, Okukenu IV, will linger for a long period of time.


Oba Gbadebo, the 10th Alake in Egbaland ascended the throne of his forebears on November 19, 2005
The anniversary which was celebrated with pomp amid series of activities, included book launch, chieftaincy installation, church service, press conference and visits to the less privileged home in Abeokuta, the political headquarters of the Egba people.


The retired Army officer was coronated on November 19, 2025 as the 10th Alake of Egbaland, succeeding Oba Mofolorunso Oyebade Lipede who joined his ancestors on February 3, 2005, nine days after celebrating his 90th birthday anniversary.


Oba Gbadebo, on Tuesday November 18, 2025, installed Chief (Dr.) Samuel Adeleke Oluwadairo, as the new Ogboye of Egbaland.


Oluwadairo succeeded the late cocoa and produce merchant, Chief Akinremi.
The colourful ceremony drew a large gathering of Egba Obas, titled chiefs, government officials, politicians, and business leaders from within and outside Egbaland.
Dr. Oluwadairo’s wife, Chief (Mrs.) Regina Oluwafisayo Oluwadairo, was also installed the new Erelu-Ogboye of Egbaland.


The Ogboye title is one of the most senior and government-approved chieftaincy positions in Egbaland.
The holder usually serves as a statutory member of the Alake-in-Council and responsible for contributing to the administration of the Egba Kingdom.
Dr. Oluwadairo in his acceptance speech, expressed profound gratitude to the Alake for the honour, describing the title as a “call to service.”


While pledging to work for peace, unity, and economic development across Egbaland, the new Ogboye said: “I feel honoured and privileged to be installed as the Ogboye of Egbaland.
“I am committed, by the grace of God, to meeting the expectations of our revered monarch and the people of Egbaland,” he said.


The anniversary's grand finale held on Wednesday, November 19, 2025 with a church service at the Cathedral of St Peter, Ake, Abeokuta with a reception and book launch that followed were something that would for many years be remembered.


Egba sons and daughters within and outside the country came home to honour their apex monarch.
It was an herculean task for the security agencies as they struggled to control both the human and vehicular movements.


The number of congregation and dignitaries at the Anglican Church was unprecedented  as religion mixed with the rich cultural heritage of the Egba people.
