“Let me make it abundantly clear that the contemporary history of Yoruba race is completely inchoate without the role of the Owu Kingdom, especially in the early 19th century downward.



“It is a thing of joy today that despite the temporary setback of those days, the people of Owu has proudly created a common cultural identity and distinct heritage within the Nigeria’s political space, especially in the South West.



“Meanwhile, in every analysis and discuss about the people of Owu and their peculiar attributes, one trait continues to be uppermost and dominant, and that is the sense of courage; you can not find any Owu man or woman without courage.”



The governor also disclosed that his administration had commenced the construction of a Dry Port at Kajola whose multiplying effects would further open up the state for investments.



According to him, the convertion of the mass buses to CNG, was part of the palliative measures taken to lessen the effects of fuel subsidy removal boasting that the state remains the first in the country to record such achievement.



“We have also invested heavily in security, thus making Ogun State one of the safest and most suitable states for investment to thrive in Nigeria. This has tremendously helped us to curtail pockets of violence across the state, especially the recent cult clashes at Sagamu.



“Without any fear of contradiction, Kabiyesi and distinguished guests here present, I can boldly say that as at today, we have perhaps the most conducive environment and adequate infrastructural development models that ensure that Ogun State is the safest place to live, work and do business and we are proud as a Government on this feat.



“We are happy because our commitment, initiatives, vision, dedication, resolute and our refusal to be distracted by treacherous politicians and backstabbers have continued to yield positive results, as existing businesses are thriving while new investments are being attracted in multitude into our dear State.”



While describing the theme of the festival as apt, Abiodun said the nation had witnessed a new dawn with the recent judgement of the Supreme Court that reaffirmed the election of President Bola Tinubu.



He noted that the nation would soon take her rightful position in the comity of nations as a result of the various policies introduced to reshaping the nation’s economy.
