‎The Divisional Police Officer (DPO) of Sango-Otta in Ogun State, CSP Idowu Olatunji, has stated that it is the blessing from God that enriches one without much struggles, "therefore, we need to police with the fear of God."‎‎Idowu, a devote Christian with Christ Apostle Church (CAC) background, emphasized that in all situations, police officers should consider the way of the Lord before they act. 


"Don't be bias; say things the way they are, and not give in to temptation to unduly punish the guiltless so as to extort him," the DPO urged. ‎‎Quoting the book of Philippians, Chapter 4, Verse 19, CSP Olatunji said "My God shall supply your needs according to His riches in glory in Jesus' name."‎‎

The DPO, who assumed duty at the Division barely six weeks ago, said he believes in the rule of law and, as such, would not be party to unjust arrest and detention of innocent citizens. ‎‎Consequently, according to him, he has a supervisory role of monitoring the activities of his operatives, saying that is where officers are held liable in the event of any misconduct by their subordinates, during which they are reprimanded for lack of supervision. ‎‎

To avert such a development, the DPO said, "since I cannot be everywhere at the same time, I regularly hold meetings with sectional heads, to orientate them on best operational standards, and expect them to pass same messages to their team members," he explained, adding that he always discourages them from oppressing members of the public to milk them."You don't need it, as God will provide for you." ‎‎

Continuing, he noted that as part of measures to be in control of the station, to see that no issue of abysmal abuse of power is recorded against his personnel, "That is why, since I reported here, I stay outside the office, sometimes up to around 2:00 am, to monitor those brought in as suspects.‎‎"This is owing to the fact that, for instance, when officers go out on raid, it is likely that there would be some innocent persons held as suspects.


"On that spot, I do my interrogation, to separate the grain from the shaft. If anyone of the suspects is not culpable, I allow such a person to go, while the culpable ones are prosecuted," he stated. ‎‎Aside from that, the workaholic DPO is seen moving from one crime desk to another, questioning perceived suspects on why they are at the station. If convinced that investigations should be escalated, he gives a nod and, if not, such suspects are set free instantaneously. ‎‎

Speaking on demand for money by Police officers before commencing investigation, the Police officer noted that it is unethical and unprofessional, saying "that is what you are engaged by the authorities to do, for which you are paid. Do it conscientiously and achieve result.
