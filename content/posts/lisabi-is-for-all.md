Assalam Alaikum Warahmotullah wabarakahtuhu



 



LISABI IS FOR ALL!



We heartily welcome His Royal Majesty Alaiyeluwa Oba Adedotun Gbadebo Okukenu IV, Alake and Paramount Ruler of Egbaland to this yearâ€™s Muslim Thanksgiving prayers to mark the LIsabi Festival.



We are reminded that this is the 24th edition of the celebration. We thank Allah that the event has been sustained, waxing stronger by the year.



We must constantly recall the rationale behind the even. Lisabi was the great warrior who led the Egba war of liberation against the empire of Alaafin of Oyo.



The Egba triumphed. When the coalition of Oyo and Ibadan forces routed the Egba and thus necessitating the abandonment of our homesteads in Egba Forest, moving Westward to settle in what is now Abeokuta, at least the Egba did so as an independent entity in 1830. Since then, the Egba have increased in population and prosperity.



Our civilization anchored on a rich culture has given us a unique position and leading status, thus making us a premier community in the new nation called Nigeria.



Had the Egba been permanently subdued by the Oyo, we woud not be what we are today.



It is therefore appropriate that we should immortalize the person who planned our survival as an independent and autonomous entity. This explains the significance of the Lisabi Festival.



The foregoing background shows clearly that Lisabi is for all Egba. He is our hero who must be celebrated by all. 



Unfortunately, over the years, the celebration has been dogged by controversy. Some have felt that it is a pagan exercise. The climax of the celebration, the visit to (Igbo Lisabi), Lisabi Forest has been represented as a gathering to render sacrifice to  Lisabi as Egba Hero. 



The result is that some of us whose religion abhors fetish celebration have had to keep a distance from the inner groves where sacrifices are made annually.



We have repeatedly called for a change in the format of the visit to Igbo Lisabi. Since Lisabi is a hero for all the focal point of the celebration must be all inclusive, embracing Muslims, Christians and traditional worshippers.



In this light therefore, the festival must no longer be dominated by traditional worshippers who continue to exercise an influence for outweighing their numerical strength They are less than 2% of the Egba population.



We must now welcome the important modification that has recently been made to Lisabi festival celebrations. 



Under the progressive leadership of Kabiyesi, the Alake, Egba Chieftaincy Committee, the highest organ in the conduct of public affairs in Egbaland, has approved a new format for the visit to Igbo Lisabi.



Henceforth, the ceremony in the inner groves of the forest will take place between 6.a.m. abd 8.a.m. 



The ceremonial visit of Egba celebrants will follow from 11a.m. in form of a carnival in a space outside the forest where men and women will assemble. 



It would be a multi-religious affair with Muslims and Christins offering their respective prayers for peace and progress in Egbaland.



Thereafter, all including Egba youths would engage in merry making, dancing and eating. 



It is hopped that in subsequent celebrations, a trade exhibition would feature so that tourist from near and far, would join, buying and selling souvenirs and other goods.



With these modifications, no one would have an excuse for not participating fully in Lisabi festival especially on the first Saturday of March which is grand finale day of the festival.



Muslims must remember that patriotism is an act of ibada. We should love our community and celebrate it along with its heroes.



May Allah accept our prayers and enhance the peace, prosperity and happiness of Egba nation within Ogun State and Nigeria.



Long live Egbaland.
