This is a big question begging for an answer since the remains of the late Egba amazon, Iyalode of Egbaland, Chief Alaba Lawson were committed to mother earth on  Friday, December 8, 2023.
The late educationist, entrepreneur and pioneer female NACCIMA President, died on Saturday, October 28, 2023, few months to her 73rd birthday.
Alaba Lawson, a woman like a man was conferred with the traditional  Iyalode title by the 9th Alake of Egbaland, Oba Mofolorunsho Oyebade Lipede on August 7 1999.
The late Egba woman was also crowned the first Iyalode of Yorubaland by the late Alaafin Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi on August 23, 2008.
The Iyalode title is a high-ranking female chieftain in Egbaland just as it is in most of the Yoruba traditional states.

In Egbaland, the title is conferred on a woman by the Alake and paramount ruler of Egbaland not minding her heirachy in the line of the women tiitles in Egbaland.
The Iyalode is a high-ranking female chieftain which is currently within the gift of Alake.
This is against the process of choosing an Iyalode in the pre-colonial Nigeria which was more of the accomplishment and  involvement of the woman to be so honoured  in economic and political matters. 
The immediate past Iyalode became so in her capacity as the Osi Iyalode and not Otun Iyalode that was then occupied by the late politician, Chief Mrs. Titilayo Ajanaku.
The Egba United Government, (EUG) of 1897, a kind of Presidential System of Government vested the leadership of Egbaland in the hands of the Alake as the President, with the Osile as Minister of Justice, Agura, Minister of Finance, and the Olowu, Minister of Works.
By the arrangement, all the four Egba Obas have major roles to play in the running of the then EUG which the grand and great fathers of the current different occupants of the Alake, Osile, Olowu and Agura were major players.

Most interesting thing about the Egba Presidential System of Government is that all the sectional Obas also have their own beaded crown which they allegedly brought from their own home steads.

It was the system that brought about Osile as the next in rank, (Otun) to the Alake, while the Agura is the (Osi), third in rank and the Olowu, the fourth in rank.

Uptil now, who ever the Otun of Egbaland is usually from the Oke-Ona where Osile is the paramount head.
On the otherhands, the Osi of Egbaland usually hails from Gbagura and the Ekerin, fourth in rank is usually from the Owu section of the Egba kingdom.
Among past Iyalode Egbaland were outstanding and illustrious Iyalodes EfunroyeTinubu, Madam Jojolola and Madam BisoyeTejuoso, who were described as role models and epitome of the best in Egba womanhood in their periods.
Below are notable  Egba women among whom the 5th Iyalode of Egbaland may emerge.
Chief Mrs. Taofikat Abolaji Afolabi, the current Otun Iyalode of Egbaland ranks among other women.
Daughter of the late Bobagunwa of Egbaland, Chief MKO Abiola, Chief (Mrs.) Lola Edewor, the Osi Iyalode of Egbaland is also on the line.
The recently installed Iyalode of Oke Ona- Egba, Chief (Mrs) Irene Folashade Kokumo also stands a better chance of succeeding Iyalode Alaba Lawson. 
Chief Mrs Olabisi Soyoye, the current Asiwaju Iyalode of Egbaland may also be considered if Alake so wished.
Chief Mrs. Ejide Sikirat,  the Aare Iyalode Egbaland is also on the qualification list.
Chief Mrs. Lillian Omotunde, the Suaada of Egbaland and Chief Mrs. 'Kemi Abeke Oloyede, the Iyaloja of Egbaland are also at the mercy of the Alake Egba to be Iyalode.
Chief Mrs. Kudirat Awopeju, who currently holds the title of Iyalate of Egbaland and Chief Mrs. Modupe Labode, the Seriki Iyaloja of Egbaland are also more than qualified for the exalted position.
The Seriki Iyalate of Egbaland, Chief Mrs. Veronica Atobatele and Erelu Otun Baade of Egbaland, Chief Mrs. Iyabode Sunmonu may be gifted with the title if Alake so wished.
