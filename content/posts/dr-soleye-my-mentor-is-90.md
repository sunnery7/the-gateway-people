In my house on 1st January 2023.. You gather with us and spoke about an Accountant who turned to a Lawyer.



Your body started showing some signs after March 13 because of our dear brother we lost but in the midst of all of these you still say…Ani lati gba fun Olorun..(.we can’t blame God)



You don’t like to be pitied and so your composure in the midst of pains and adversity taught me a great lesson.



A man who is concerned about the extended family.



He cares about all Soleye’s Family and in fact anyone who is close to him.



Happy birthday Dr.Onaolapo Olusegun Soleye in your style of full name.



You are not an ordinary man.



Your 90 years birthday is a life full of memories of someone who touched lives and showed a good example of honesty, integrity and tolerance.



Even in your old age ..I still see people come around to ask him for help in cash.



I said to him daddy..Your pension from UI is not even enough for you;; tell anyone that comes that you are a retired lecturer and you did not steal money as Minister of Finance.



He will say…Ma worry…Things are tough for them; you talking now…you are helping a lot or people too…Ika odogba…( Fingers are not equal)



Even the take home of many cannot take them home.



What else do I want in life.?.All of you are around me and I lack nothing.



If you are honest, if you have integrity, if you are Godly, if you are hardworking, if you like to study well, if you are patient; then You will be a friend to Daddy.



When Daddy want to sit you down for gist…



“How Country” is that word and then we would begin.



Daddy will brief me what happens before I arrived.



Very common…report I get from Daddy goes like this ” Stephen sese kuro nibi ni…Tokunbo Debi laaro.(.Stephen just left; Tokunbo came in the morning.”



Deacon Oyedele..Baba Ibeji…is also an ally of daddy.



I remember Engr.Tony Ojesina who is another nephew of Daddy…I also remember Bro. Toyin Jokosenumi too…I met them at daddy’s place.



The two regular persons are uncle Steve and uncle Toks..



The three of us..must meet at Daddy’s place by all.means .A good.man to us all.



ECONOMY is a must anytime i.go to the house.



Wo.( look)..”What are they doing about Exchange Rate”?



Daddy will say now that Court has affirmed the President , .Kiwon Fi Bola Tinubu sile kan je o Govern.Ilu o rogbo now ( let them leave Bola Tinubu alone and let him Govern because things are tough for people.).



Happy birthday to You sir as you celebrate this 90 years in the land of the living.



No matter what happens after now; You lived well and we are all proud of you
