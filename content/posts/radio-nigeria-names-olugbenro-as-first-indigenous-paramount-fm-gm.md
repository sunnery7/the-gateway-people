In a historic move, Radio Nigeria has appointed Mrs. Oluremi Olugbenro as the first indigenous General Manager of Paramount FM 94.5 Abeokuta.
This is with a bold promise to drive innovation, deepen community engagement and elevate the station’s legacy of excellence.

Olugbenro officially took the reins on Wednesday, August 6, 2025, at the Broadcasting Hill, Kobape, where she delivered her inaugural address to staff and stakeholders.

Describing her appointment as “a huge honour,” she expressed gratitude to Almighty God and commended the board of the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN), especially the Zonal Director, Mr. Dominick Mokikan, for entrusting her with the leadership of the iconic station.

“Paramount FM isn’t just a radio station; it’s a cornerstone of this community. We’ve been the soundtrack to life here for years, providing information, entertainment and a platform for local voices.

“That tradition of excellence is something I’m deeply committed to upholding and enhancing.”

Outlining her vision, Olugbenro said her administration would embrace digital transformation and innovative programming tailored to meet the evolving needs of the audience.

“We’ll explore new ways to engage our audience — from dynamic digital content to on-the-ground community initiatives.

“We’ll continue to be the first choice for news, the best source for music, and the most reliable voice for our community’s needs and aspirations,” she stated.

The GM also stressed the importance of teamwork and an open-door leadership style, urging staff members to contribute ideas and energy toward making the station more impactful.

“I believe in the power of collaboration, and I want to hear your ideas. My door is always open. Together, we will not only maintain Paramount FM’s reputation as a leading station but elevate it to new heights,” she concluded.
