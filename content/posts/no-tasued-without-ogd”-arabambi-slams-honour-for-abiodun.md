The National Vice Chairman of the Labour Party (South West), Dr Abayomi Arabambi, has faulted the decision of the Tai Solarin University of Education (TASUED) to honour Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, describing the move as unjustified and historically misleading.

Arabambi maintained that TASUED remains the singular vision and enduring legacy of former Governor Otunba Gbenga Daniel (OGD), whose administration conceived, established and nurtured the institution despite stiff opposition at the time.
He said “There is no TASUED without Otunba Gbenga Daniel. That is a historical fact. The question now is simple: what exactly has Governor Dapo Abiodun contributed to TASUED to warrant any form of honour?.

“Any attempt to rewrite history or downplay OGD’s foundational role in TASUED amounts to intellectual dishonesty and a disservice to future generations,” he added.

The Labour Party chieftain accused the Abiodun administration of failing to make any meaningful or transformative impact on the university since assuming office, insisting that the institution continues to grapple with numerous challenges.

He listed infrastructural decay, inadequate funding, staff welfare issues and an unconducive learning environment as some of the unresolved problems confronting the institution.

“Under this administration, TASUED has not witnessed any landmark intervention, expansion or policy support that can be described as legacy-driven,” Arabambi said.

“So, on what moral or academic basis is this honour being bestowed?” he queried.

Arabambi further described the proposed honour as politically motivated, warning that academic institutions must not be turned into tools for image laundering or political validation.

He also cautioned that celebrating leaders without verifiable impact not only undermines the credibility of the institution but also insults the sacrifices of those who laboured to build TASUED from the ground up.

“Universities should be centres of truth, history and intellectual integrity, not platforms for political propaganda. Honours must be earned through measurable impact, not political convenience,” he stated.

“OGD’s legacy in TASUED is visible and permanent. Until Governor Abiodun can point to a clear, lasting and measurable contribution to the growth of the university, any attempt to honour him remains unjustified and unacceptable,” Arabambi stated
