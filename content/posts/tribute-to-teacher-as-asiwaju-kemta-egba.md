There are many woods in the  forest—some hardy, some ordinary, some merely ornamental. But when the time comes to create the gbedu, that great drum whose timbre commands kings and warriors to hearken, only a rare, resilient, and resonant wood is considered. 

Gbedu is not just any drum—it is the drum against which all others are measured, the drum by which drums themselves are defined. Such is the story of Dr Wasiu Tejuoso: a man chosen not just for a title but for the substance of his existence. In the forest of Kemta and indeed Egbaland, he is that rare wood—seasoned by experience, tested by time, and refined by grace—to sound the rhythms of leadership for his people. To be Asiwaju Kemta Egbaland is not merely a ceremonial wreath; it is a divine mandate soaked in heritage and destiny.  

The Asiwaju title is not for the ordinary; it is reserved for those whose influence transcends self-interest, expressed in collective service, scholarship, and the preservation of cultural traditions. An Asiwaju is a leader by action, not merely by designation—one who lays a path for others, shaping the future through merit and diligence. Leadership is not inherited; it is earned. 

As a scholar, Dr Tejuoso embodies the discipline, dedication, and integrity that define the spirit of Kemta’s values. As Head of the Department of Mass Communication at Moshood Abiola Polytechnic, Abeokuta, Ogun State, he leads with vision and purpose, inspiring excellence while laying the foundation for a lasting legacy.  

Beyond academia, his impact is widely felt—he is a staunch advocate for youth empowerment, ensuring that the next generation is enriched with knowledge, opportunity, and vision. His journey to this moment has been shaped by inspiring mentors and enduring values. From childhood to his academic ascent, the seeds of service, inclusivity, and integrity were carefully planted. 

His parents stand first among his role models, guiding him and his siblings towards distinction.  And then there are two stars that shine particularly bright in his constellation of mentors—late Prof Lai Oso, whose intellectual legacy continues to illuminate minds, and Evang. Bidemi Osunbiyi, a benefactor and guardian figure whose guidance provided both spiritual and emotional grounding. Their contributions shaped a man whose leadership is matched only by his passion for service. "Ile ni a n wo, kí a tó sọ́ ọmọ l’órúkọ" —"One must look at the home before giving a child a name." 

His upbringing and mentorship laid the strong foundation upon which his leadership now stands, ensuring that he carries forward principles forged in wisdom.  A glance at his accomplishments tells a compelling story. With a decade-long education scholarship scheme, he has transformed lives—providing opportunities for Egba and non-Egba indigenes alike. 

In every mentee he nurtures, in every lecture he delivers, Dr Tejuoso affirms the simple truth: leadership is service in motion. But his gaze is fixed beyond the present—he is determined to continue his mission of shaping lives, mentoring youths, and positioning Kemta as a force among peers in Egbaland.  

The new Asiwaju is looking toward the future, recognising that the world is evolving rapidly. Artificial intelligence, digital technology, and innovation are redefining the way people work, learn, and connect.  He envisions an era where Kemta’s youth are equipped not only with traditional values but with the technological expertise necessary to thrive in a competitive global landscape. 

His commitment is to blend heritage with progress, ensuring that Kemta remains rooted in its rich past while embracing the opportunities of tomorrow.  Dr Tejuoso does not walk alone on this journey. Beside him stand companions of honour—his age-grade brethren, professional colleagues, childhood friends, club members, and alumni associations who understand the depth of his devotion and the weight of his responsibility. They gather at this honoured moment not merely to celebrate a title, but to acknowledge a life of meaningful impact.  

Kemta has chosen well; Egbaland will reap the rewards of this choice.  Indeed, in the forest of life, not every tree becomes gbedu.  But when one does, its voice resonates across kingdoms. So it is with Dr Wasiu Tejuoso—teacher, builder, leader, and Asiwaju of Kemta.  Kemta has chosen well. 

Egbaland is better for it. 

Baawa!
