Twelve years ago on October 3, 2025, the Nigeria's celebrated undertaker, Olatunji Adedeji Okusanya and son, Olatunji Abimbola Okusanya both died.


Okusanya was the proprietor of the MIC Casket in Lagos who before his death had handled several funerals across the country.


The father and son's death occured in an ill-fated Associated Airline crash.
Deji Falae, son of Chief Olu Falae, Ondo state born politician and one time presidential candidate was among the 13 passengers that also died in the air crash. 


The plane was carrying the corpse of the late former Ondo State Governor, Dr. Olusegun Agagu, to Akure, the Ondo State capital, for a lying-in-state and burial when the unexpected happened.


Another casket was used to bury Segun Agagu after the crash!


Unfortunately, at the time of his passage, Okusanya left behind his aged mother, Madam Juliana Olayemi Okusanya.
She passed away in July 2017, four years after her son and grand-son's tragic death. 
MIC Funerals, one of the biggest funeral companies in Nigeria, has given befitting burials to eminent Nigerians.


These included the funeral of Chief Oluwole Awolowo, the first son of the late sage, Chief Obafemi Awolowo.


May their souls continue to rest in peace.
