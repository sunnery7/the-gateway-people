Growing up in Ijebu-Ife, in the heart of Ijebu East Local Government Area of Ogun State, my world was one of flat farmlands, low plains, and thick vegetation. I never encountered a single hill or mountain, not in childhood curiosity nor in adolescent wanderings. Even when I moved to Lagos, where the land meets the Atlantic, I remained surrounded by coastal flats and lagoons, unaware of the rugged beauty hidden in other parts of our nation.


That changed when I ventured to Ondo State as a young student at the School of Agriculture, Akure (now Federal University of Technology, Akure). It was there that I first understood what it meant to climb a hill. Every morning, we ascended the slope to wait for one of our lecturers, Mr. Benbela, whose classes often began at the top. Those early treks were more than exercise, they were my first communion with elevated land, with nature rising above the ordinary.


My first visit to Abuja deepened this revelation. The capital city’s skyline is shaped not by skyscrapers but by rock formations that have stood for millennia. I made my way to Zuma Rock, standing like a silent sentinel at the gateway to the city, its giant face gazing over the plains of Suleja. Soon after came Aso Rock, the city’s granite heart, which I later photographed through all the seasons of the year, its contours shifting gently with the light and weather.


From that point, I was captivated. Hills and mountains were no longer mere landforms, they became stories etched into stone, timeless and patient witnesses of our nation’s journey.
In my travels, no region holds as much rugged beauty as Plateau State, a land of ancient granite outcrops, undulating ridges, and serene valleys. It is, without question, Nigeria’s most beautiful state.


The Shere Hills, rising east of Jos, are among the highest points on the Jos Plateau, reaching over 1,700 metres above sea level. Standing atop them, you feel suspended between earth and sky. The air is cool, thin, and pure, and as your eyes sweep across the horizon, you realise how dramatically the landscape shifts from state to state, a mosaic of natural splendour woven by time.


Further afield lies Assop Falls, cascading from the rocks of the Plateau, feeding life into the valleys below. Here, one witnesses how geology becomes art, where water, stone, and vegetation paint a picture of Nigeria’s heartland at its finest.


From Pulka in Borno State, where scattered rock formations dot the landscape, to the borderlands of Adamawa, the earth begins to rise again, blending with the Cameroonian Highlands we once studied in geography classes. I recall a climb in Adamawa that took nearly four hours, every step revealing a new vista, every turn offering proof of how nature rewards patience and endurance.


And then there is Taraba State, home to Nigeria’s highest point, Chappal Waddi, standing tall at 2,419 metres above sea level, on the Mambilla Plateau. The plateau itself is an otherworldly stretch of green meadows and rolling mist, where cattle graze in serenity and clouds drift at eye level. It is, without question, the most beautiful place in Nigeria.


Descending into the Southeast, the land transforms again, into the soft undulations of Enugu, whose name means “hill top” in Igbo. The Udi Hills dominate the landscape, their slopes rich with coal seams that once powered Nigeria’s early industrial years.


Whenever I travel through Enugu, I am reminded of the old Third World song “Lagos Jump”, the rhythm of the land rising and falling like music itself. The hills here are gentler, but no less soulful, carrying the stories of generations who built their homes upon their sides.


Back in the Southwest, the hills take on a subtler grace. Oyo State surprises many with its elevation, from the Bower’s Tower overlooking Ibadan, to the interior hills near Iseyin and Okeho, nature reveals her hidden contours.


But if one seeks true spectacle in the region, Ekiti State stands proudly second only to Plateau. Here, forests rest atop hills, waterfalls leap from ridges, and every road seems to wind through elevated beauty. The very name Ekiti derives from Okiti, meaning “hill” in the local dialect, a fitting name for a land of heights.


Then there is Ondo State, home to the world-renowned Idanre Hills. Rising nearly 1,000 metres above sea level, the Idanre Hills tell a story of civilisation, faith, and resilience. Climbing its ancient steps, one encounters shrines, caves, and the remnants of old settlements that whisper tales of centuries past. No one stands before Idanre without a sense of reverence, it is nature preserved in majesty.


Nasarawa State lies quietly beside the Federal Capital Territory, yet it too hides marvels, rugged hills and massive rock formations shaped by the ages. The Farin Ruwa Falls, among the highest waterfalls in Nigeria, descend dramatically from the plateau ridges. Each time I traverse this region, I am reminded that wherever there are hills, there are springs, fresh, pure water that emerges from the deep, as though the earth itself breathes.


In the South-South, Cross River State claims its place among the highlands. The ascent toward Obudu Ranch Resort is a journey of wonder, steep, winding roads that defy logic, cutting through mist-shrouded mountains. Standing atop Obudu, with clouds beneath your feet, you understand why this is one of the ten places every Nigerian should experience before leaving this world.


Through the decades, I have climbed rocks, crossed ridges, and stood at Nigeria’s highest peaks. In every hill and mountain, I see not just stone and soil but the resilience of our people. The landscape mirrors our strength, sometimes rough, sometimes serene, always enduring.


Our nation is not defined only by her cities or politics but by her geography, the quiet poetry of her land. And yet, too few Nigerians have seen this beauty firsthand. Until those entrusted with tourism and culture commit to intentionally showcasing these wonders, even we, her children, will not fully grasp the splendour of the country we call home.


Heavenly Father,Bless this land called Nigeria, from her lowest valleys to her loftiest peaks. 
May her hills and mountains stand as symbols of hope, strength, and unity. 
Let her rivers flow with peace, and her skies open with grace.


Grant wisdom to those who lead, courage to those who build, and vision to those who tell her story. 
Let every Nigerian come to see the beauty that lies within, in our land, our people, and our spirit.
May Nigeria rise in prosperity as her mountains rise in glory.May she succeed in peace, progress, and purpose.Amen.


As I continue my lifelong journey across this vast and wondrous land, I invite you to experience more of Nigeria’s beauty in my upcoming 1,000-page pictorial book on Nigeria, a visual and literary odyssey through her landscapes, people, festivals, and stories. Within its pages lie never-before-seen images captured over decades of travel, from the tranquil valleys of Taraba to the misty peaks of Plateau, from the rolling hills of Ekiti to the sacred stones of Idanre. Each frame is a tribute to our shared heritage, a reminder that Nigeria is not just a country, but a living masterpiece waiting to be rediscovered by her own children and celebrated by the world.
