In Memory of Alhaji Tunde Oladunjoye


*By Tayo Mabeweje*


Some men write history.Others live it.A rare few do both—with ink, voice, and presence.
Alhaji Tunde Oladunjoye was such a man. Not one to be easily ignored, his presence loomed large wherever conviction was required. He was not merely a spokesman; he was the pen of the Ogun State All Progressives Congress—resolute, deliberate, and often unfiltered.


He didn’t just issue statements. He carved opinions. He defined responses. He stood where many would have swayed.


Through political tempests and ideological storms, he remained firm—never afraid to ruffle feathers if the cause demanded it. To him, politics was not a popularity contest. It was a battlefield of ideas, a sacred duty to defend the truth as he saw it, and to guard the interests of those he served.


Yet, beyond the press briefings and debates, there existed a man of immense depth. A grassroots builder. A people’s man. A former Chairman of Ijebu East Local Government who left footprints on the soil of leadership—visible, impactful, and inspiring.


He did not seek applause. He sought results.


He did not aim to please. He aimed to deliver.


He mentored the youth, opened doors for the excluded, and amplified voices long ignored. 

And in all things, his faith was his anchor—steadying him in both triumph and trial.


Now, the pen is still. The rhetoric has ceased.

And what remains is legacy.


To his beloved family—his wife, children, and all who held him dear—may you be wrapped in peace and lifted by the strength he lived with daily.


To his comrades in the APC and colleagues in the media and governance space, a true warrior of words has signed off. His voice is now eternal.


Let the archives speak of him. Let those who sparred with him remember the force he was. Let future generations discover that there once lived a man who did not hide behind diplomacy when clarity was required.


Rest now, Alhaji.The battle is over. The pen is down. The story is unforgettable
