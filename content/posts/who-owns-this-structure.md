Who owns this property? That's the question on the lips of many residents of Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital.



Arguably, the tallest building in Abeokuta and indeed the entire state is located in Ibara, the high brow area of the state capital.



Although, the structure sprang up during the administration of the former governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, works have since stopped on it long before the administration exited.



Its abandonment has led to the building becoming abode for miscreants and other criminal intended people, young and old.



Findings at the Ogun State Ministry of Urban and Regional Planning, Oke Mosan did not reveal the real owner of the building.



The land used to house the defunct Oceanic Bank until it was demolished and the tall building emerged.



The state government should beam its searchlight on the ownership and ensure completion to avoid imminent disaster arising from decaying.



Its long abandonment spanning over five years is an invitation to disaster to happen. 



Those in authorities must not allow the unexpected to happen before they swing into actions.



This must be avoided in the interest of residents of the gateway capital
