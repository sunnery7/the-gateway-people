While charging graduands to make use of the skills acquired in positive ways, Lemo added that integrity would also stand them out in their interactions with people.



According to him, the students have been given uncommon skills and talents 

which they must not be allowed to be wasted without being used for the benefit of humanity.

Founder/Chairman Board of Trustees of the centre, His Grace, Peter Jasper Akinola, disclosed that the centre founded in 2011 was primarily established to make youths economically viable as well as take them off the streets.



He lamented that many Nigerian youths are roaming the streets looking for jobs that are not available.



Dean of the Church of Nigeria Anglican Communion, Most Rev. Blessing Enyindah, who was visiting the centre for the first time, expressed delight at the conducive environment under which students study.
