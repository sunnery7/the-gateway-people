For the Nigeria's Minister for  Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, Dr Betta Edu, it is square peg in the right hole.



At least her actions since appointment by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu pointed to this direction across the country as she visited flood prone areas.



In one of such recent visits was the one to Isheri, Agboyi and other communities, along the borderline between Lagos and Ogun states.



The two communities were majorly affected by the recent flooding in both states. 



Already, 33,000 people have been directly affected as a result of the recent flooding in Isheri communities in Ogun and Lagos.



Decked in a reflective jacket, Edu navigated the affected areas with a canoe, including Agboyi-Ketu, Owode Onirin, Isheri, Ajegunle, Agiliti, Kara, Majidun, all in Kosofe Local Government area, and Agboyi Ketu Local Council Development Area respectively.



While  assuring the victims of immediate humanitarian response, the minister maintained that the federal government was interested in supporting those who lost their businesses to the flood. 



She also gave assurances that President Bola Ahmed Tinubu's administration will find a permanent solution to the perennial flooding in the affected areas.



Edu disclosed that buffer dams required to empty the Oyan overflow river will be built by the relevant Federal Government Ministries,  Departments, and Agencies, in line with the President's Renewed Hope Agenda.  



At Isheri, where the community's monarch and village heads came out en mass to receive her, Edu, assured them of continuous engagement intervention until the problem was solved permanently. 



"I bring greetings from President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who is deeply concerned and has directed me to visit this place to provide immediate relief materials for families affected while we take decisive action to revive the livelihood and small businesses affected by the flood", she said.



The minister who delivered food and non-food relief materials to the traditional rulers and representatives of Ogun and Lagos state governments,  pleaded with victims of the natural disaster to be patient with the Federal Government as it works with the state to provide a permanent solution to the perennial flooding. 



At Agboyi Ketu in Lagos, the minister inspected the affected areas alongside the House of Representatives member representing Kosofe Federal constituency, Hon.Kafila Ogbara.



According to her,  President Tinubu had rolled out many new and existing social intervention programmes,  including Conditional Cash Transfers, Traders Monies, End Hunger Program, etc to tackle humanitarian and poverty challenges facing vulnerable Nigerians. 



“We are here to assess the extent of the damage caused by the recent flooding in Agboyi-Ketu, Owode Onirin, Isheri, Ajegunle, Agiliti, Kara, Majidun, all in Kosofe and Ketu Agboyi local council areas and to also present food and nonfood items as a form of humanitarian assistance and response. It is in line with the Renewed Hope Agenda of President Bola Tinubu".



“The president is deeply touched by this flood challenge and he has promised to bring a permanent solution to this reoccurring problem. 



"We are well aware that beyond these palliatives, what you desire is a permanent solution to this perennial flooding and I shall communicate your message to the Federal Executive Council. 



“I want to assure you that talks are ongoing about the construction of buffer Dams to tackle this challenge and when next I'm here, it will be to join other ministers and government officials to commission some of these projects that will help to permanently end this problem”she assured.
