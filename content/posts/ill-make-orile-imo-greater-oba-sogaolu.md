The last Olu of Orile was Oba Kolawole Mathew Olubiyi, who joined his ancestors  on July 28, 2018.

He commended the people of Orile Imo for maintaining peace and tranquillity during the period when the stool of Olu of Orile Imo was vacant. 



The governor said this clearly portrayed that the Imo people were a peace-loving people that have put the interest of their community  above personal interest.



According to him, the installation ceremony was another demonstration of his administration's unrelenting determination and commitment towards ensuring that the state takes its rightful position in the comity of states.



"We realise the fact that traditional institution and its leadership must be properly positioned as it serves as a bridge between the people at the  grassroots and the government.



According to him, the installation of Oba Oluwambe Sogaolu marked another symbolic step in the right direction.



The governor also commended the Alake and paramount ruler of Egbaland for his fatherly role towards the appointment of Oba Sogaolu.
