It is no more time that the impending succession to the revered stool of the Awujale and Paramount Ruler of Ijebuland has reignited intense historical and legal scrutiny, with mounting evidence indicating that the next monarch should emerge from the Bubiade section of the Fusengbuwa Royal House.Though, historians, customary law experts, and concerned Ijebu stakeholders argue that such a choice would complete a long-overdue rotational cycle and restore equity among the ruling houses.

The Awujale institution, one of the most enduring traditional thrones in Yorubaland, is governed not only by influence and seniority but by deeply rooted customs, lineage, and rotational justice. Central to the current debate is the unfinished rotation among the descendants of Oba Jadiara, whose lineage forms the foundation of the Fusengbuwa Ruling House.

Historical records traced the royal lineage of Fushengbuwa ruling house of Ijebu-Ode to Oba Jadiara, who reigned between approximately 1680 and 1695. From his dynasty emerged three principal royal houses: Fusengbuwa, Tunwase, and Bubiade. By long-standing Yoruba custom, these houses are entitled to present candidates to the Awujale stool in a rotational sequence designed to promote balance, peace, and fairness.

Although the name Fusengbuwa Ruling House gained official recognition during colonial administrative reforms between 1957 and 1958, scholars noted that it comprises several sub-lineages, including the Bubiade family. Importantly, Bubiade is historically recognised as the senior, first-born line descending directly from Oba Jadiara—a fact that carries significant customary weight.

Oba Jadiara begets four children, Bubiade, the first child, Adeberu, Adelubi and Funsengbuwa, the last born. Historical data reveals that the Fusengbuwa, himself became the 41st Awujale between 1790 and 1820, while the Tunwase, from the second lineage of Fusengbuwa Ruling House ascended the throne between 1886 and 1895. Despite being the eldest lineage of Oba Jadiara, the Bubiade Royal House has never produced an Awujale.

Observers describe this as a glaring anomaly that contradicts both customary Yoruba succession principles and historical fairness. Under customary law, the passage of time does not extinguish an unfulfilled rotational right. As such, the exclusion of Bubiade is widely viewed as an unresolved injustice rather than a settled matter.

The Chiefs Law of 1957, particularly section 4(2), formally recognises four ruling houses in Ijebu-Ode — Gbelegbuwa, Anikinaiya, Fusengbuwa, and Fidipote. This declaration was approved on August 25, 1959, and was subsequently registered. Earlier scholarly works, including those by Badejo Adebonojo (1947) and Tunde Oduwobi (2017), document the reigns of past Awujales and affirm the legitimacy of the Jadiara lineage, which includes Bubiade.

Historical records further sshows that several Awujales from the broader Jadiara/Fusengbuwa lineage ruled after Oba Jadiara, including Mekun (1712–1722), Oniyewe (1745–1750), and Fesojoye (1765–1769). After the Fusengbuwa reigns ended in 1820, Oba Tunwase (1886-1895), Oba Adekoya (1916) and Oba Adenuga (1925-1929) also ascended the throne – all from Jadiara/Funsengbuwa Ruling house. They all came from two of the three sections of Fushengbuwa ruling house. Bubiade line, however, remains the only branch yet to be represented.

The legitimacy of Bubiade’s claim resurfaced prominently in June 1983 during the political crisis surrounding the attempted deposition of the immediate past Awujale, Oba Sikiru Kayode Adetona, by the late Ogun State Governor, Chief Bisi Onabanjo.

At the time, respected Ijebu Prince, Adeoye Odedina warned in the National Concord newspaper, Wednesday, June 29, 1983, that appointing another Awujale from the Funsengbuwa section would be “customarily wrong,” insisting that such a move would violate the rights of other royal lines—particularly Bubiade. He maintained that the Jadiara Royal House, with Bubiade as a central lineage, was customarily next in line.

Odedina also dismissed claims that the Bubiade family lacked male descendants. Historical accounts clarify that it was Adeberu, Bubiade’s junior brother, who died without issue, a development that temporarily enabled Fusengbuwa to ascend with Bubiade’s consent. The Bubiade lineage continues through Adefowokan, son of Bubiade, whose descendants — Basorun, Adewale, Olufeko, Bojela, Pasuda, Aina, Asafadebo, and Asefilelo — remain eligible under custom to present a candidate.

As discussions intensify, the Ogun State Government, kingmakers, and elders are being urged to uphold the principles of rotational justice that have historically sustained the Awujale institution. Advocates warning at disregarding Bubiade’s claim risks legal challenges, social unrest, and reputational damage to a monarchy widely respected for order and adherence to tradition.

Stakeholders argue that recognising Bubiade’s turn would reaffirm Ijebuland’s commitment to fairness and prevent the concentration of royal power within a single lineage. Also, analysts conclude that history, customary law, and documented precedent converge on one point: the rotational process for the Awujale stool remains incomplete without the ascension of a candidate from the Bubiade Royal House. Honouring this claim, they say, would not only correct a historical imbalance but also preserve unity within Ijebuland and uphold the legacy of Oba Jadiara.

As the succession question looms, the choice before Ijebu’s custodians of tradition is increasingly framed as one between expediency and justice — or between repeating history and finally completing it.
