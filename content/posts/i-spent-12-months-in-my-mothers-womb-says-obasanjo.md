Former President, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo has sensationally revealed that he spent 12 months in his mother's womb.



This is just as he lamented that his late mother did not live to witness his greatness in life.



Obasanjo spoke at the presentation of the drama titled “Aremu Omo Asabi,” during the 66th remembrance programme held in honour of his late mother, Mama Bernice Obasanjo.



The ceremony held  at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, OOPL, Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital.



Obasanjo, who lamented that his mother did mot enjoy the fruits of her labour also told the audience that his mother battled with witches and wizards while carrying his pregnancy.



“I was told I was in my mother's  womb for 12 months and since I was born, I have not been left for once.



" She had nine children but two of us survived, myself and my sister but I was the only one who went to school because my father’s belief was that no matter how educated a female child is, she would end up in the kitchen.”



Ogun State governor, Dapo Abiodun, in his speech described Mama Bernice Obasanjo as a great woman.



According to him, Obasanjo's mother's influence would continue to endure through the lives of her children, especially Chief Obasanjo, who remains a formidable figure in Nigeria’s history.



Represented by his deputy, Engr. Noimot Salako-Oyedele, the governor said that mothers will forever be the bedrock upon which the foundation of any society is built. 



While appreciating the musical drama, Governor Abiodun said the play was not just an historical recount, but  a poignant reminder of the sacrifices mothers  make for their children.



"This tribute is a call to action for all of us to honour and support morgers in every way possible".



"It reminds us ofnour collective responsibility to create an enabling environment where every mother's hope for their children can flourish", the governor stated.
