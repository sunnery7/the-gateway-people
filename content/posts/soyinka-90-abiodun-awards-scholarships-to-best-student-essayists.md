To mark the 90th birthday celebration of the Noble Laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka, the Ogun State Government has awarded scholarships to nine students who performed creditably well in an essay competition.



Three hundred and eighty three students participated in the competition, with 90 being chosen, while nine were selected.



Alabi Oluwanifemi, emerged the best essayist, with Okoye Collins John and  Adebusi Adeoluwa coming second and third respectively.



The 2024 Wole Soyinka International Cultural Exchange  (WSICE) Programme 

drew students from different parts of the country who participated in an essay competition on national and international topics.



The event held at Prof. Soyinka's ARI residence, Ijegba, Abeokuta, on Monday, with Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun, announcing laptop each for  their efforts.



The gesture, Abiodun said was  to encourage the beneficiaries to keep writing as well as motivate other students to participate in the next edition of the competition.



He described the noble laureate as the most celebrated black African, who had exceled in his chosen career.



The governor also noted that It was imperative to engage the youth and ensure that their thinking and goals are oriented toward progress for the motherland and humanity.



He said the WSICE was established to honour the legacy and reflects Prof. Soyinka's lifelong commitment to education, cultural exchange, and in nurturing future leaders.



According to him, the initiative underscored his values, which include justice, freedom, and the pursuit of excellence in the arts and humanities.



"Engaging National Interest on Good Governance, Understanding Nation-Building (E.N.I.O.G.U.N)," perfectly encapsulates Professor Soyinkaâ€™s profound commitment to creating a just and equitable world.



The WSICE consists of three aspects, which comprise essay competition, the advocacy, and the performing arts, which include poetry, drama, and spoken word. 



"We celebrate a project that, for over 14 years, has upheld his ideals and vision. There is no doubt that the Nobel Laureate has optimally utilized the inherent values and wisdom of African culture and tradition in his global engagement as a world citizen of African descent.



"The mission and underlying objectives of WSICE are clear and commendable. They seek to create unity among mankind regardless of nationality, culture, or religion by focusing on youth as the future of humanity, in line with the thoughts and guiding principles of Professor Wole Soyinka."



The project, Abiodun said is designed to serve as a beacon, illuminating the path for future thinkers who are passionate about the progress and betterment of humanity, pledging that the State would take ownership of the event to make it international.



Speaking while answering questions from children on his life experiences for the past 90 years, Prof. Soyinka said that he did not envisage living up to 90, adding that he decided to be a writer to correct some anomalies from stories he listened to while growing up.



On why he broke into a radio station during the military era, the Nobel Laureate said: "I never broke into a radio station, but sneaked in. The radio station was holding on to something that belonged to the people, and I decided to retrieve it. If that item had been played, it would have demoralized the people and established the culture of brutality."



Soyinka chided Nigerians for always critising the state but refused to examine themselves. 



He noted that crimes like kidnapping and robbery, among others are not because of poverty or inequality, but selfishness and the desire to live a luxury life.
