Ahead of the 2026 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination(UTME), the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), on Saturday said it had screened a total of 924 Computer Based Test (CBT) centres across the country.
The JAMB Registrar, Prof. Ishaq Oloyede disclosed this during an interactive session with state Commissioners for Education in Lagos.

According to him, the centres will go through the final test before the final accreditation to participate in this year UTME registration and examination.
Oloyede said the 924 centres would go through the final test before final accreditation in order to participate in the 2026 UTME registration and examination.

According to him,  the purpose of the meeting was to sustain stakeholders’ collaboration with commissioners for education to ensure hitch-free registration and conduct of the 2026 UTME and Direct Entry (DE).

“Prior to commencement of registration exercise, the board conducts accreditation exercise, to check the suitability of each CBT centre, for the conduct of its examination.

“A rigorous accreditation exercise of the CBT centres had been carried out for the 2026 UTME.

“Members of the accreditation team included the Chief External Examiners (vice chancellors, Rectors and Provosts), Technical Advisors, JAMB State Coordinators, and JAMB Technical Officers,” he said.

“It is to also share JAMB’s vision, policies, and strategies for the 2026 exercise, including new measures to strengthen integrity and efficiency.

“It is to further leverage state platforms and networks to support effective public sensitisation and information dissemination to candidates and stakeholders.

On when this year UTME would commence, Oloyede said that Mock and UTME candidates would register first before the DE candidates

“The sale of UTME application document, which is the e-PIN, will start earlier than commencement of actual registration which is January 19 to February 26.

“Actual UTME registration period is between Jan. 26 to Feb. 28 at all approved CBT centres.

“The close of mock selection is February 16 while the sale of DE application documents and E-PIN vending will commence on March 2, and close by April 25,” he said.

He added that registration would be available at all JAMB offices.
