A REFLECTION OF THE ECLIPSE OF MY SUNSHINE MUM, MRS.DEBORAH ADEBIMPE OTUSANWO ADENEYE.



God has many ways of making the children of those who died early to fulfill destiny.



Though, the beginning of such children might be heart-grindingly rough with tough times and denials of needed Aloe Vera to nourish and smoothing their bodies, but all of these would turn into means of passages to becoming 'the Conner Stones of Unspeakable Testimonies'.



Once upon a time, I lived with the junior brother of my dead mum who made me to work as a blacksmith, Mondays to Fridays and Saturdays and Sundays on his farm.



It was indeed a slave-camp I found myself on my mum's death.



I would see his wife prepare 'Eba' for us, including her children. My plate was specifically marked with a red stone, to enable it be differentiated from her children's plates.I did not complain but sometimes, would shed tears.



She would serve her children from the pot of stew, while still on fire and thereafter pour out water and serve mine.



You can imagine the solution of putting water into an Egusi soup that someone would use to eat Eba. 



Eba was for me, Mondays through Sundays but her children had other alternatives.



Today, we could still be having children like that whose mothers left them in the hands of their relations, they should not lose hope.



I believe God is always standing by them to go through the torrents, waves and tortures of every weather, to energise them, to stand strong in all ramifications.



Today, my name is Dr.Biodun Adeneye-Marcus, Media Practitioner and author of more than 52 educational books, among which is listed in the Curriculum of Lagos State Ministry of Education.



60 years ago, by tomorrow, October 10, 1964, only two months and few days to my 5th year birthday anniversary, my mum, Mrs. Deborah Adebimpe Otusanwo Adeneye died on my hands.



God of Grace and Favour, You are worthy to be praised. Amen.
