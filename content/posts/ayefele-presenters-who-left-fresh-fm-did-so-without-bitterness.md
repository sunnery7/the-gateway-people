It is no longer news that some notable staff presenters of Fresh FM Nigeria have taken their exits from the esteemed group of radio communication outfits. Indeed, they have left  for other businesses and professional endeavours.  



In this regard, Babatunde Saheed (Mr. Sport), Oyetayo Oladimeji (Mc Handsome), Adesina Jagunmade (Paj 1) and Akinwale Fasasi (Wiseman), have all left our platform. 



The board and management consider this, a natural reality any organization could go through in the usually competitive corporate journey. 



It is not in the character of Fresh FM Nigeria to hold down or hold back anyone who desires to leave the company, after all, no one is expected to work with a company forever, not even the Founder. 



It is, however, heartwarming to note that none of the presenters who recently left Fresh FM Nigeria did so with any form of acrimony or chaos. 



The Chairman/CEO, Dr. Yinka Ayefele (MON), views such exits as a necessary phenomenon and a natural cause of action for the peace and progress of a worker/professional, especially for those who left the company and for the Fresh FM Brand itself. 



Even as it could be said that noone is indispensable, we can categorically say that those who just left the company would be missed in their areas of expertise and influence, because of their positive contributions to the meteoric rise of the Fresh FM brand since inception in 2015. 



That is why the company is extending the best of wishes to them as they journey into new business and professional environments. 



Dr. Ayefele, therefore, expresses his heartfelt appreciation to them for heartily believing and energetically keying into his vision of making Fresh FM, the King of the Southwest among the multitude of radio stations. 



It is also Dr. Ayefele's wish that those who left would find peace, progress, good fortunes and contentment. He further urges them to maintain their core values of diligence, loyalty and focus. 



Moving forward, Dr. Ayefele is pleased to inform esteemed lovers of the Fresh FM brand and the general public that their darling stations; Fresh FM Ibadan, Abeokuta, Ado Ekiti, Osogbo, Lagos and Akure, as well as Blast FM and Tiwa-n-tiwa FM in Ibadan, shall continue to wax stronger with irresistible contents from professionally - endowed producers and presenters, through pleasing programming. It's in our DNA to be the best among equals. 



He adds that Fresh FM listeners should look forward to a 2024 that will usher in unequalled growth, enviable expansion and all round prosperity for Fresh FM Nigeria and Yinka Ayefele Limited. 



Dr. Ayefele wishes lovers of the Fresh FM brand a happy, prosperous new year.
