The former Primate of All Nigeria (Church of Nigeria Anglican Communion), the Most Rev. Peter Jasper Akinola, has lamented rising number of girl-destitutes in the country.



Akinola, who is also chairman, Board of Trustees of the Peter Akinola Foundation Youth Centre for Industrial Training, Abeokuta,  spoke during this year's graduation of 132 students of the centre. 



The foundation, a Non Governmental Organisation was established in 2010.



The centre is focused on training of Nigerian vulnerable and indigent youths in vocational skills in order to make them self reliant.



The centre's departments include Fashion/Creative Art Designs, Metals & Aluminion Fabrication, Catering &Tourism Management, Computer Studies, Electrical/Solar Installation and Building Construction.



Of the 132 graduants, the Tunde Lemo Foundation, trained 32 students as well as equipped them with necessary working tools and equipment.



The representative of the Tunde Lemo Foundation at the event, Oba Reuben Oluwalambe Sogaolu charged graduating students to be good ambassadors of the foundation as well as the centre.



Meanwhile, the foundation  has further extended its humanitarian gesture of training Nigerian vulnerable and indigent youths in vocational skills. 



Under what it  tagged: "Talomola Initiatives", it tends to rescue young Nigerian girls who got pregnant as a result of sexual abuses, wayward behaviours leading to abortion and suicide which could be injurious to the mother and unborn baby.



According to Akinola, the maximum number of girs that could be accomodated for a start is 12, while the time frame between rescue, delivery and training should not be more than eighteen  months.



"The concepts of the Talomola Initiative are to provide comprehensive care viz-aviz food and nutrition, health care services, legal services, psycho-social supports and religious services", he stated..
