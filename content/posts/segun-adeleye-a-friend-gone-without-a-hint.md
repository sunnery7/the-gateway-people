The death, on Wednesday 12th, March 2025, at 58, of Segun Alani Adeleye, has robbed members of my generation of a professional, fine journalist, a prolific writer and a kindhearted fellow. Not surprisingly, there have been an outpouring of tributes from across Nigeria and beyond only for a man who earned the respect of many. Little wonder, this world is fleeting, ephemeral, will-o‚Äô-the-wisp.

 What is man that thou art mindful of him? Man, whose breath is in his nostrils, the good book says. By a personal belief, there are some people who ordinarily should not die, because of their goodness, their humanism, the great impact that they make within the community, family and colleagues. 

The death of good men or women diminishes us, a part of us leaves with them, but what endures ultimately is the lesson of their example. One of such good persons was Segun Adeleye. Death is a debt that all living things owe, and which they must pay when called to the Celestial Lodge above. 

We are told in Psalm 89: 48. ‚ÄúNo one can live forever, all will die. No one can escape the power of the grave. ‚ÄùEcclesiastes 8:8: says ‚ÄúNone of us can hold back our spirit from departing. None of us has the power to prevent the day of death. There is no escaping that obligation, that dark battle.‚Äù  Knowing this to be true about death, the public‚Äôs number one enemy, we must as a people of faith accept the fact of our own mortality, and take solace in the worthy life of impact and illumination that Segun lived. 

Whatever may be the circumstance behind his death, Segun was a very pleasant man with whom I related very well for almost a decade. He was also a strong advocate for peace, cooperation, hard work and self-determination at all places. He was a former State Correspondent of Daily Independent. 

A prolific writer and journalist of repute. A strong member of the Council in his lifetime, a member of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR), Sport Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN), and the Development Communication Officer (DCO), for Ogun State Rural Access and Agricultural Marketing Project (RAAMP). Certainly, we are as good as that breath in our nostrils. When it ceases, we are done, gone, across the bridge, to eternal life. And that is if only we are conscious of this daily. But as human beings, we often forget, and live as if it would last forever. 

But the masquerade festival always ends, no matter how long it lasts. Therefore, whether it‚Äôs long or short, let‚Äôs make our life matter. Segun did, and it ended on 12th Wednesday. He now rests, after what Shakespeare calls ‚Äúlife‚Äôs fitful fever,‚Äù where we are like actors on a stage, and we have our entrances and exits. Affirming that he was no more after the news of his sudden demise got me was so painful. It was like that, I suppose because we, mortals, are always guilty of thinking we can live forever and thus forgetting that every day is a bonus from God. 

Segun was a man I owe so much in high esteem and now they say he is gone. Gone to where? Just like that? It is painful, shocking and sad. Egbon Segun why? What happened? Segun was above anything else experienced and talented in his field of call. Indeed, life is about memories! It is the only thing we are left with when flesh and spirit departs the earthly plane and we can do no more than remember the life of the departed, through times and memories shared, especially their deeds in their lifetime. It wasn‚Äôt a joke. It was true. He was 58. 

Death is the most treacherous fact of life. Its finality reminds us of the finiteness of our mortality. As painful as his demise might seem, I am also glad he was a modest man and he earned everyone's respect. Albeit rest, they say, is sweet after labor. Segun had a lifetime of work. He was poised to have his due rest. But the rest became eternal. He has been laid to rest. He lived a disciplined life as attested to by many, including family, friends and other well-wishers in their tributes and I agreed completely with them all. For sure, it is a known fact that people die every day, but all of them affirm for us the goodness in humanity like Segun. I am glad our path crossed. Times and circumstance decide who we meet in life. Our hearts decide who we want to retain in our lives, and people's behavior determined whether we want them to remain in our memories or not. 

Segun! I am glad our paths crossed. Yes! death may have ended his life at a time we least expect, but not the relationships he had built with many over the years. And because of this alone, a lot of people who knew him are understandably still going through grief, denial, depression and acceptance. He was a man of wisdom. Strength and dignity were his garb. And also, his gift and his legacy. Painful end indeed. His demise remains depressing and shocking, but there's no time for a lengthy farewell. 

Pondering all through, I asked! God, what then happened? How and why did you allow this? Again, I thought, God we should not question you, but what really happened? As mere mortals, we don‚Äôt know. But we will surely understand it better by and by.  For now, we mourn with the Adeleyes. We weep, we sorrow, but not like those without hope. Our hope is that one day, Segun will rise to life eternal. And Death, the enemy of man, shall die. Death, thou shalt die. It‚Äôs not a curse. It‚Äôs just your inevitable end. 

We have travelled together on several occasions in the course our official assignments. On the air and on the road. What a grief, what a tragedy. I saw Segun in February, in Abuja which unfortunately, turned out to be our last encounter. Segun died on Wednesday, curiously not in terra incognita, which the sky is. But rather on terra firma, solid ground.  I feel a deep sense of personal loss, and hereby join others in commiserating with members of his family, his wife, barrister Taiwo Adeleye and the children, people of Ogun State, journalists, members of other professional bodies that Segun belong, and everyone in the larger Nigerian community who was privileged to have encountered his person, influence, and benefitted from the grace of uncommon measure which the Almighty bestowed upon him and which he used, at various levels for the benefit of mankind and for the elevation of the human spirit. As we therefore, mourn the late asset to humanity cum illustrious son of Oke Odan town in Yewa South Local Government area of Ogun State, I also want to commiserate with all RAAMP Development Communication Officers (DCOs), family where Segun once belong and specifically to my sister, the National RAAMP Development Communication Officer, Mrs. Amadi Vivian who, for days was inconsolable understandably because of her closeness with Segun. He was her right hand man at all times. For now, let us all reflect on Segun's legacies of simplicity, professionalism and a form of self-respect that did not at any time seek self-advertisement. Unfortunately, these enduring virtues are conspicuously absent in the official profile of most people today. Egbon Segun deserves to be celebrated and remembered. His example should inspire the living. Thank you, Segun, for your friendship. Goodbye and goodnight‚Ä¶

Olusegun Alani Adeleye: A pillar of strength and wisdom

On behalf of the Ogo Oluwa Community Development Association, we pay tribute to our beloved late Mr. Olusegun Alani Adeleye, who selflessly served as our legal advisor. His passing leaves a void in our community, but his legacy of positivity, wisdom, and kindness will continue to inspire us. As a liberal democrat, Olusegun embodied the values of compassion, equality, and justice. His gentle yet powerful demeanor earned him respect and admiration from all who knew him. He was a true communist at heart, always putting the needs of others before his own, and his impact on our community will be felt for generations to come. Olusegun's contributions to our community were multifaceted. As a media juggernaut, he used his platform to amplify the voices of the marginalized and to promote social justice. His commitment to the development of our community was unwavering, and his guidance and wisdom were invaluable to us. We remember Olusegun as a devoted father, husband, boss, brother, and uncle. His love and dedication to his family were evident in everything he did. 

He was a shining example of what it means to live a life of service, compassion, and kindness. As we mourn the loss of this remarkable individual, we take comfort in the knowledge that his legacy will live on through us. We will continue to strive for the values he embodied and to make our community a better place for all.The community has promised to name a road after late Olusegun Alani Adeleye in memory of his commitment to the welfare and success of Ogo Oluwa Community Development Association. 
Rest in perfect peace, Alani Baba Desire. Your memory will continue to inspire us to be better versions of ourselves. Unquestionable God has taken away, a man of Honor in our community. 
MUSBAU SEMIU ADEMOLA, MSA,
For Ogo Oluwa Community Development Association. Baba Segeas I fondly called you. It's very hard for me to say goodbye* üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ but your untimely death still very miserable to me. If it's the will of God, He knows better. May Almighty God forgive you all your shortcomings and rest your soul. My dear brother, our last discussions bothers on how to open the rural roads for our people and the need to use Iweke, Irogun, Eredo and even suggested a farmers market at Olorunda junction connecting Oju-ota Asafo through Alagbede Road linking Ajilete. We discussed extensively on the  major Agricultural corridor  in that axis with series of farm products.You have the template of the reports with you already and you promised to give it all the required follow up at your rural agency. What a great dream and lufty Idea... So painful that we both conceived this rural project for the benefit of our people but you left us unannounced. You have already made your impact at all levels.Adieu Olusegun Alani Omo Adeleye sun re ooo. Boda Segun,Odigba, Odigbere, Odarinnako,I pade doju ala.

May Segun's soul continue to rest in perfect peace. Painful to bear as he was a loving, gentle and easy-going brother. The circumstances? O ye Olorun. May the Lord be with the wife and children he left behind. Good bye, brother.

Bro Sege, as I fondly called you while you were on the face of the earth, may your journey to eternity be free obstacles. I sincerely pray that Allah Azawajal saves you from the trials and punishment of the grave. May your grave be turned into a garden of paradise! Journey well, Alani Omo Adeleye. Your life might be short, but, it was eventful and impactful. Though, you are no more, I am still bewildered and heavy-hearted.  Adieu!!!!

It is well, it is well, it is well. Good Night, may the Lord grant you eternal rest and comfort the family you left behind. It's painful but who are we to query God. He's an unquestionable God. Adieu Segun Adeleye!  May your soul rest in perfect peace. Almighty God will comfort your wife, children and the entire family. 
He will be with them as they go through this trying period and thereafter.

We thank God for his life. May the Good Lord grant him eternal repose and give family and friends the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss. Goodnight our friend and brother, Segun Adeleye. Hmmmm, May you continue to rest in peace. I remember how we used to converge at the Punch office in Ijemo, Abeokuta before our daily assignments then,  Egbon Segun, Good Night.

Good night Segun. You were honest and straightforward. Whenever things were going tough, you would say Baba Niyo, take things easy. When I came back from your burial, I looked at the text of our last conversation, I still couldn't comprehend that you are gone. Rest in peace my brother and friend. God loves us all.
NIYI ODEBODE 
**\*,\*\*\****
I'm short of words, still can't comprehend üò≠üò≠üò≠. May Almighty Allah accept his return and grant him aljanah fidaous..Our meeting was simple. Very simple. Me, a stranger in Abeokuta. Segun, an on the ground journalist. The Guardian had sent me on a relief duty when the late Charles Coffie-Gyamfi was on leave. I was to spend only three months in Abeokuta but it turned to six months, months that brought unto my journey some enduring and remarkable friendships, of which Segun was one.
We met on my first day in the office. He was coming down from the Punch office which was upstairs. "Hello, my name is Segun Adeleye of Daily Independent. Are the guy that is relieving Charles?, he asked. My initial thought was to be careful, but Segun stretched out his hands, and as a proper Yoruba man, I had to shake his hand. "Yes, My name is Mustapha Ogunsakin, I replied.
The next thing, I heard him shout, "Niyi, come downstairs. You have a new neighbour". I was to learn that Niyi is the Punch Correspondent. Niyi came downstairs and he introduced us. This was the beginning of a relationship that has lasted for 21 years, until his last journey, leaving me and Niyi Odebode to continue.
Although I live in Lagos, Segun always makes me feel that I am in Abeokuta. Even when Niyi was in Abuja, we never really parted, making calls and asking about each other's well being.
Four years ago, my daughter gained admission to FUNAAB. Segun ensured that he got contacts that will make her stay in the school enjoyable. One of such contacts is his junior brother. My daughter was shocked when I told her of your demise. 
Niyi Odebode was with me at the Annual Lecture of Gavel International on November 29, 2024. These are a few products of meeting with great minds!
I want to thank God that our paths crossed. You made me value the virtue of being gentle, cheerful, and friendly. 
Journey well great friend. May your rest be peaceful. May your memory be a blessing to your family.  May the Almighty God uphold the family you left behind.

Segun, the reality of your death hasn't weighed down on me since it dawned last week as much as now when the fact that your body is about to be interred in the next few hours today started taking its toll on me. Caught in the depth of sober reflection over your passage,I said to myself in my native tongue, "ao ma ni ri Segun mo for life ma niyen", meaning "So Segun we won't see Segun again for life". 

Segun so painful I won't be chanced to pay my last respect at your funeral service nor beside your grave  to see your remains being lowered into the grave. "Omo  Adeleye"( I can't even see well I as I got to this line of typing because my vision is now blurred with tears rolling down my cheeks). Segun,( tears rolling down torrentially again)your death pains me deeply almost like when I lost my dad who is my hero. I'm more pained by the mystery surrounding your death which is yet to be unravelled.

Your death is too bizarre and gruesome to be diplomatically and maturely play down or relegated to the background, in order to give you a befitting burial. The more it sounds like insinuation the more the pains(tears again). I'm too emotional to continue typing. Segun, we leave everything to God. Iku e ye olorun Segun. Segun please rest well. Sleep well. Your "handsome l'omo latile" bids you journey well. I'm sorely missing you already.
The memory of our closeness in Ogun State Correspondents' Chapel where we were Bureau Chiefs of frontline national Newspapers is indelible. The memory of our continued friendship and professional relationships  when we both left journalism and reunited as Public Relations Executives till your death, with me in public and you in private practice lingers. Goodnight for life (tears) Segun.This is very difficult for me to type because this goodnight is not the kind that avail me the privilege of seeing you the following day to say good morning.You are gone for life but your legacy lives on. Dear readers pardon any grammatical lapses, I'm too emotional,my vision intermittently blurred with tears.This is not about syntactic structure or the likes but the passage of a dear soul who at the time of typing this peace he's about to be buried.
\[21/03, 19:22] ATABA: IJOBA, as I usually called him. He had left an indelible mark, he had  done his best for humanity at that very short time. IJOBA Segun Adeleye, you came, you saw and you conquered. Rest in perfect peace. It's still difficult to come to terms with the fact that Sege is gone. All I can say with some heavy heart is goodnight Sege. It's a pity that we both have unfinished job, o ye Olorun.

ADIEU Our COO!
I don't know where to start because you meant everything to me, your uncommon humility, your gentle disposition, your professional dexterity, your love for family, your genue compassion for friends and numerous other qualities that stand you out as a man for everyone. 

When I first introduced Black Heritage International Magazine publications to you at Iwe Iroyin, you stood up and said, because of the quality of the magazine, my brother, I will make sure I get some prominent people to be featured and not only that I will be part and parcel of the publication from today on. And since about 12 years ago and up till your last days, you remain an enigma, you took the publication as your own, you asked for the ID card and other details that would make you one of the personalities behind the publication. 

We traveled far and wide conducting interviews for numerous accomplished Nigerians, we organized awards ceremonies, you got in touch with other colleagues to be part of the publication. You did all these without waiting or looking for any benefits.
Since the day of your demise, I find it extremely difficult to sleep in the night because I couldn't believe you are no more with us, you are such a rare breed, you love your friends effortlessly, you are an uncommon husband and a father to your wife and children, you are selfless, you are a comforter. It will be very difficult to forget everything you personified.  

As you fondly called me, Publisher! and I would say COO ( Chief Operating Officer), at a time you said I should be calling you 'Editor at Large'. We would joke, shared memories while having drinks. Every member of the magazine team will miss your professional touch. Ha! Iku doro, Dear Brother, Segun Alani Theophilus Adeleye, it is certain that you will rest well in the bossom of the Lord, your good work will endure forever, you are a blessing to humanity. Sun re o. I am also using this opportunity to commend all friends, family, colleagues and everyone who made his final journey a successful befitting one. 
A o ni fi iru e gba funrawa o Amin . We shall all leave long in Jesus mighty name of Nazareth Amen.
PRINCE OYEWALE KEHINDE OYEWALE

May Jehovah the God of comfort be with the wife and children.
Good night Leyu" No doubt, Segun you fulfilled your destiny. It is not how much but how well.

The departure of Segun Adeleye remained a terrible and permanent shock for me and many. I am yet to recover from the trauma of his death.How and why remained my companion till now. I chose not to give an account of my relationship with you, not because it wasn't pleasant enough but rather to save many from the possible emotional trauma that would have caused them. That you are no more is not news again, and it was evidenced in the burial arrangements that you lived by all required of a man of virtue, value, and humility. To those of us left behind, at our level of riches, wealth, position, and Intel, Mr. SEGUN ALANI ADELEYE's death is enough for us as a lesson. √Äk√≥k√≤ t√≥ ≈Ñ Luigi nigbo is making an impact because a life of no impact is a life of no VALUE... Nature is married to two wives, and posterity and history both gave birth to Reference and preferences, which are intimate friends of human actions that catch up with them when they are powerless and after their demise. Behold, I owe you a BSc in History and International Relations. So help me, God, to get it done in the next 4-5 years. Alani Baba Desire, Continue to rest in perfect peace.
