There was excitement in Abeokuta, the capital of Ogun State on Saturday, August 23, 2025, as the crème de la crème of the Nigerian society gathered for the Nikkah ceremony of Faizah Omoteniola Kolapo and AbdulHakeem Jimoh.


Omoteniola is the daughter of the Publisher of The Point Newspaper and Iya Sunnah of Egbaland, Dr. Yemi Kolapo, while  AbdulHakeem is the son of Brig. Gen Olanrewaju Jimoh (retd).

Many of the dignitaries, who came from far and near to celebrate with the Kolapo and Jimoh families, said even if the destination of the wedding had been farther than Abeokuta, they would sacrifice for the two families, especially considering the philanthropic and kind nature of Yemi Kolapo and how the groom’s father, Gen.
