Olopade, Managing Director of Nilayo Sports Management Limited and Osi-Asoju Oba.of Egbaland noted that the Ibara GRA had remained a pivotal location within Abeokuta.



According to him, aside the GRA offering shelter to civil servants since the inception of Ogun State in 1976, he added that the prime area had been under-utilized and undervalued.



in a release, Olopade said the current efforts of the Abiodun-led administration to rejuvenate and redevelop the prime real estate space marked a significant step towards harnessing its potential and creating value for the people of Ogun State.



“This administration has demonstrated remarkable political will by envisioning and initiating the regeneration of Ibara GRA and the Government Housing Units at Idi Aba, among other locations.



"This project, which spans 40 hectares in Abeokuta alone, is set to deliver modern, smart cities where residents can live and work in a holistic ecosystem. 



"The inclusion of between 4 and 5-bedroom housing units, complemented with world-class infrastructural facilities, is a reflection of the governor’s commitment to excellence and modern urban living.



“This redevelopment not only addresses the urgent need for modern estates across Ogun State, especially in its capital, but also showcases the ingenuity of the government in leveraging Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) to drive its ISEYA initiatives. 



"By prioritizing local content, engaging artisans, suppliers, and developers within the state, this project is poised to create approximately 20,000 direct and indirect jobs within the construction value chain. 



"Such a move, coming around the same time the state is set to host the national sports festival is indicative of the administration’s strategic approach to job creation,youth empowerment, and economic development.



“The governor’s magnanimity and empathy are evident in his directive to prioritize the housing needs of civil servants through flexible options like rent-to-own, outright purchase and mortgage facilities. 



"This inclusive strategy, which birthed the housing schemes in Kobape, Kemta, Ilaro, Sagamu, and others, ensures that public servants across different income levels can also benefit from the new housing schemes, thereby enhancing their welfare and productivity.”



“This project not only rejuvenates decaying assets but also ensures Ogun State’s sustained positive growth and development.



“The people of Ogun State are indeed fortunate to have a leader who is not only attuned to their needs but also proactive in creating opportunities for a better future. 



"Governor Dapo Abiodun’s administration continues to set a high standard in governance and urban development, reinforcing Ogun State’s status as a model for other states to emulate,” Olopade stated.
