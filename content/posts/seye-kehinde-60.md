...Happy New Year to the Moon of the Street Journalism 



His birthday was yesterday, but today he steps into a new chapter — a fresh year filled with grace and purpose.


It is, therefore, imperative to pen this tribute to a rare soul who defied all odds to transform what was once dismissed as 'rubbish' — the soft-sell version of newspapering — into an admirable, respected, and sought-after genre in Nigerian journalism. 
At 60, many celebrate longevity. But for Seye Kehinde, Publisher of City People Magazine, it is far more than the number of years — it is about the depth of impact, the strength of legacy, and the power of tenacity.


Here is a man who has not only weathered the storm of Nigerian journalism but tamed it with grace, grit, and golden purpose. Seye Kehinde is not just a journalist; he is a trailblazer, a pioneer, a refined craftsman of personality journalism — a brand he didn’t just adopt but created, nurtured, and elevated to a national institution of pride.


From the humble beginnings of selling only 4 copies out of an ambitious 5,000-print debut, many would have faltered, but not Seye. He stood tall, undaunted, resilient, strategic, and calmly defiant against the odds. That “never-say-die” spirit has remained the engine of his success.
In a media space sometimes tainted by “cash-and-carry” reporting, Seye Kehinde walked a different path. He is ethical, objective, disciplined, and principled. Never for once did he resort to blackmail or yellow journalism. His pen is guided by truth, dignity, and a passion for celebrating those who have made a difference.


Soft-spoken, approachable, humble, yet intellectually sound, Seye is the most unassuming genius you’ll ever meet. He is loyal to his friends, generous with his network, and passionate about lifting others. From unknown startups to seasoned professionals, he gives a platform to those who dare to dream. His pages have told the untold stories of Nigeria’s finest, inspiring generations and shaping narratives.


Indeed, he is the Moon of Street Journalism — always shining, always calm, always watching and illuminating paths with soft light and sharp insight. As he clocks 60, I do not just say Happy Birthday , I reverently salute a legend, a gentle force, a credible voice, and a national asset.
Seye Kehinde will soar beyond our imaginations. His kind is rare. His story is gold.His legacy is eternal.
Congratulations, my great brother , the world is better because you write, you capture , you print and you publish. 


May You Live Long Happy New Year
