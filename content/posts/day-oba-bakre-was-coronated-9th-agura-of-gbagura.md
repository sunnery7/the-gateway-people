Gbagura, Abeokuta, Ogun State capital, the homestead of the late Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola, the winner of the June 12, 1993 Presidential Election was literarily aglow on August 18, 2019 as Oba Saburee Babajide Bakre, Jamolu II,  was coronated the 9th Agura amid splendor and pomp.



The monarch was in May 2019 presented with official instrument of office by the administration of Ogun State governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun.



There may have been many coronations of Aguras in the past in Abeokuta, but the coronation of Oba Bakre was splendour in all its ramifications, both in planning and the event proper.



It was a carnival-like as Gbagura sons and daughters, young and old, friends and others adorned in the special attire, (Aso Ebi) for the occasion trooped to the coronation ground as early as 8.00a.m.



Dozens of chairs and tables arranged by groups, societies, clubs and associations under different tagged canopies spread across the major roads from Enugada to Ago-Ika, Idi oparun area of the gateway capital.



It was a hectic day for security agents, particularly the Police and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps among others as they struggled to control traffic heading towards the venue.



A road block was mounted at the "Enugada" with the police allowing access to only those going to the coronation ground, while commercial drivers were barred.



Right in front of the Asuni's House was another road block with the police appealing to invited guests to make a detour within the frontage of the Unity High School and the Anglican  Church become the parking lots.





At about 10.45.a.m. the new Agura emerged form the inner room of the palace, which is under rehabilitation.  Dressed in Aso Oke, he was accompanied by his wife and  sandwiched by Ogboni chiefs into the waiting hands of his people.



Earlier in the morning, a white G-wagon, Bitrubo Vs with special number plate, AGURA has been positioned at the entrance of the palalce for the new Agura to ride to the coronation ground.



To the shocking surprise of his subjects, the new monarch declined to ride in the exotic car. Instead he trekked  to the coronation ground amid drumming and singing.



With Ogboni chiefs watching the new Agura's steps, the convoy danced towards the coronation ground along the old Ogunwolu's house, Ibikunle's house,  Gbagura Central mosque, Kotu-Ikeye, Sanni's house and eventually arrived the coronation ground, infront of former Bodunrin's house at about 11.07a.m.



The new Kabiyesi was welcomed into the event venue with "Gbedu" drum by eminent personalities including the Alake and Paramount ruler of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Aremu Gbadebo. 



Alake's convoy including Aro of Egba, Chief Clement Kufile, Aare Egba, Seriki Egba and Aare Baroyin of Egbaland, Chief Lai Labode among others had earlier arrived the Agura palace at about 10.41.am. but later moved to the coronation ground.



While the Agura and his entourage took their seats, the duo of  events comperes,  and broadcasters, Wale Dada and Akeem Akintunde  continued to announce arrival of invited personalities until about 11.49a.m. when the Ogun State Deputy Governor, Mrs. Noimot Salako-Oyedele, who represented  Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun arrived the coronation ground.





The Speaker, Ogun State House of Assembly, Hon. Olakunle Oluomo had earlier arrived at about 11.45a.m. while the Senior Special Adviser to the governor on Political Matters, Tunji Egbetokun, the Chief of Staff to the governor, Alhaji Shuaib Salisu also arrived  at 11.57a.m. after the duo  of Oyedele and Oluomo were already seated.



At exactly 12.01p.m. the ceremony formally commenced  with an opening prayer rendered by an  Ifa devotee, Ifaseyitan Odofin in Ifa mythology. This was followed by the Islamic rendition by Muiden Olubodun, a representative of the Chief Imam of Gbagura, Prof. Kamaldeen Balogun. The Christian version of the prayer was rendered by the Anglican Bishop of Egba West, who was represented by Mr. Babawale.



Shortly after the prayers, the former president, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, the Oluwo Ooje-Ile, dressed in the coronation attire arrived the scene with his wife, Bola and others  amid hailings. 



Initially, the Baloguns across the Gbagura townships were to lead the homage until it was re-arranged and the  Ologboni led by their Oluwos kick-started the traditional greetings and homages to the new king. 



This was followed by the ''Oloye Obinrin'' led by the Iyalode Egba and Yorubaland, Chief Alaba Lawson, wishing the new Agura long reign, strength and courage to lead his people.



The Alasalatu, Omo Ilu, Ikeye-Ojo community Ibadan and others who followed in that order also paid their homages.
