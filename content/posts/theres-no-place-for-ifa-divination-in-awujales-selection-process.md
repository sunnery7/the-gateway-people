The Chief Law of 1957 of the Customary Law Regulating the selection process of Awujale of Ijebuland Chieftaincy does not recognise Ifa divination.

However, the government document recognises four ruling houses in the following order; the Anikinaiya, the Fusengbuwa, the Fidipote and the Gbelegbuwa respectively.

According to the official document,  the persons who may be proposed as candidates by a ruling house must be members of the ruling house and must also be of male line.

It further states that in the event of no male to succeed in such a family, the declaration states that the succession may devolve on the female line.

"In such event,  the mother of the candidate must be an "Abidagba"  I.e. true born when the father was on the throne, except that where there is no such "Abidagba", any child of an Oba born before his or her father reigned could be selected.
