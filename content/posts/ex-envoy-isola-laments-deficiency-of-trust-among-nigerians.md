The immediate past Nigeria's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, Amb. Sarafa Tunji Isola, has lamented that the culture of trust is fast disappearing in the country.



This is even as he noted that building trust should starts from family,  the smallest unit of the society.



In order to build culture of trust that would help national development, Isola also canvassed that Nigerians must embrace attitudinal change.



Amb. Isola spoke alongside former Resident Electoral Commissioner to Ogun and Anambra States, Elder Ahmed Raji, SAN and the Director of TVC Entertainment, Dr. Morayo Afolabi-Brown.



The trio spoke during a public discussion organised by the Mass Communication Department of Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago Iwoye, Ogun State.



The event wlth the theme "Trust and National Development in Nigeria", also had the supports of  the Nigeria Union of Journalists and Nigerian Institute of Public Relations.

Isola, a one time Minister of Mines and Steel Development, said: "trust building starts from the smallest part of the society".



According to him, once trust was broken, it would only be difficult to amend as it will just be graduating,



His words: "if you cannot trust your uncles, neighbours, how will you trust the local government. If you don't trust people at the local governments, how will you trust those at the state level and so o.."



The former Secretary to the Government  of Ogun State, believes that the problem of trust deficit could be tackled with attitudinal change particularly  from the angle of the led who would not mind electing into offices people who are without characters.



He stated that this category of people do not have the required competencies and capabilities to deliver on good governance.



"It s high time we began to focus on the led than those leading us when we have this type of national discussion because who voted these people in? 



"The led did, the people did, it is a case of egg and the chicken, this is why we all have to do self appraisal and see where we have all missed it and retrace our steps".



To enhance mutual trust for national development, Isola said that Nigerians must imbibe high sense of patriotism where the development and progress of the country is prioritised by everyone irrespective of status and tribes.



The Ã¨x-envoy also canvassed adoption of an indigenous Lingua Franca other than English.



This he reasoned would  help foster trust and national cohesion among the over 250 ethnic tribes in the country.



A resounding applause from students of the Department and other dignitaries greeted Isola's submission. 



Elder Raji, in his own submission, blamed poor electoral processes, failed campaign promises as among other factors fuelling distrust in our national development.



 "Nobody will trust a political leaders who emerged from a manipulated or elections that is not free and fair. Who will also trust a leader who get to the office and fail to fulfill his or her campaign promises.



He added: "all of these,  contribute greatly to the problem of trust deficit between the led and their leaders"



The former REC, charged the Nigerian  youth to change the narrative through  the new Supreme Court judgment on local government autonomy.



This he said they could do by being the next face of good governance, accountability and transparency at the grassroots.



"Rather than submitting yourself to be used as thugs, and ballot snatchers, take the advantage of the recent Supreme Court judgment on local government  autonomy.



"Go there and take charge of your local government. Go there and change the narrative such that people will begin to feel the effects of good governance at the grassroots".



Group Head, TVC Entertainment and anchor of the popular television show, "Your View", Dr Morayo Afolabi-Brown, emphasized the need for young Nigerians to be orientated to get a new Nigeria.



She charged  the students not to expect anyone to come around and fix the challenges of the country.



To achieve a great nation, the popular anchor, urged Nigerian youth to have a

change of heart and begin to do the right thing at their own little corner.



Though the government might have its shortcomings but a lot is required from each and every one of us too to tackle the problem of trust deficit,



Head of Mass Communication Department of the institution, Dr Lanre Akinola  said that the essence of the public discussion was to see how the yawning gap of trust could  be bridged.



"The challenge of trust is a global phenomenon, it is not something that is only peculiar to Nigeria and this is why we should all do all that is within our ability to change the narrative. It is the duty of both the governed and the leaders".he concluded.
