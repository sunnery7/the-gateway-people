The race for a new Awujale of Ijebuland, in Ogun State has begun.
This was through the official rolling out and beating of the traditional "Gbedu" drum by the next ruling house.


 By order, records and official gazette, the next royal house to produce a successor to the latest Awujale, Oba Sikiru Kayode Adetona is Fusengbuwa Ruling House.


The Fusengbuwa Ruling House comprises eight branches.
In Ijebu-Ode, there are four ruling houses in Ijebu-Ode; namely; Anikilaya, Fusengbuwa, Fidipote, and Gbelegbuwa. 


The immediate past Awujale, who joined his ancestors last  Sunday and buried the following day hailed from the Anikilaya Ruling House.


Traditionally, the drumming which held last Thursday, three days after the burial of the late Ijebu-Ode monarch was a significant cultural tradition that marks the intention of the next eligible ruling house to present a candidate for the Awujale stool.


The  head of Fusengbuwa Royal House,  Otunba (Prince) Adedokun Ajidagba, expressed the readiness of the family  to present a qualified and worthy candidate among its princes. 


He canvassed unity and support among members of the royal house during the selection process.
“It is our tradition to beat the Gbedu drums immediately after the demise of an Awujale, signaling the next ruling house to produce a successor. 


"This event is part of the spiritual and traditional process of selecting the next monarch.”
According to him, the family had received a certificate of affirmation from the Ijebu-Ode Local Government in 2023, officially recognizing Fusengbuwa as a legitimate ruling house.


 “Whoever emerges must be accepted by all and must uphold the traditions of Ijebu,” he said.


The general secretary for the four ruling houses and the Fusengbuwa family, Prince  Adeleke Adeyemi expressed delight that he had maintained accurate family records for over 20 years.


“It is our right and responsibility to present a qualified and respected prince with a strong background", he stated.
