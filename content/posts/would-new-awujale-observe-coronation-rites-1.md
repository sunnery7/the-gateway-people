In view of the controversies that surrounded the public funeral of the late Awujale of Ijebuland, Oba Sikiru Kayode Adetona, the question on the lips of many Ijebu indigenes is wether the new Awujale would not observe coronation rites.

As in other Yoruba towns and cities, there are many traditional rites to be performed before, during and after the passage of a traditional ruler like Awujale.

These rites would preceed those by kingmakers, towns and other critical stakeholders for the new Awujale.
For example, Ilese, an Ijebu town in Ijebu-Ode Local Government Area of Ogun State has a major role to play in the coronation rites for a new Awujale of Ijebuland. 

Among several other traditional rites is the carriage of the new Awujale after installation ceremonies at Ilese by one of the Elese's men over the Owa Stream.
A black ram among other traditional items is also said to still be given to the  servant of the Elese  as a mark of  gratitude by the Awujale.

The gift is said to be a mark of gratitude by the new Awujale for the bond of kinship that exists between Ijebu Ode and Ilese from the time Immemorial.
The man who carried the late Oba Adetona across Owa in 1960 was Asipa Badekale (Baba Debamgbe) of Oke quarters, Ilese.
It is customary and traditional for an Awujale-elect to be brought to Ilese for the last lap of the rituals of his installation.

The new Awujale must be presented by the Odi. Then all rituals will be performed  during the installation ceremonies at Itamogan.
This is said to be an age-long rite and ritual which was observed  by the late Awujale, Oba Adetona during his ascension procedure in 1960[](http://1960.lt/)

Omo-Oba 'Segun Adebanjo in a book,  Ilese (Ulu-Ese), the story of a people and royalty) wrote: "at the traditional installation rites for the new Awujale,  Elese would give him an ancestral beaded crown".
He continued: " it is the first crown the Awujale wears before using any other crown. The crown is returned to the Elese after Awujale had arrived at Ijebu-Ode by messengers from Imose in Ijebu-Ode in those days".
Adebanjo further stated in the book:  "the tradition was re-enacted in 1960 in Ilese when Alayeluwa Oba Ashiru Adenle gave the crown for the traditional crowning of the new Awujale of Ijebuland,  Oba Sikiru Kayode Adetona.

"Elese is the Oba who with his own crown on his head and his beaded staff in his hand crowns an Oba of Obas, the Awujale of Ijebuland".
"One of the rites for a new Awujale at Itamogan is the presentation and beating of Elese's Akoto Drum for him. Lotu-'sere Lanrewaju Oredugba of Ilone Ilese did this for Oba Adetona in 1960", he disclosed.
"The Akoto appears only on two occasions yearly at Ilese, at the Idemunu festival and when the Agbon remembers Agbon Masaku at an annual rite at Oju Masaku.

According to him, "that the Akoto is brought out for the new Awujale shows the kinship ties".
Before departing from Itamogan, Obanta and Elese mutually agreed at the Elese's annual Idemunu festival that Ajogun, (who later became the Awujale of Ijebu -Ode) should present the token of a ram to the Elese, his uncle to receive his blessings. 

"This is carried out yearly by the  Awujale and was so through out Oba Adenle's reign (1924 to 1966)".
Prince Adebanjo went on to disclose that Elese Ashiru Adenle, who reigned from 1924 to 1966 crowned four successive Awujales between 1925 and 1960.
The Ilese Prince said Oba Adenle was already on the throne when Awujale Ademolu Fesogbade joined his ancestors on October 15, 1925.

"Four successive Awujales who as descendants of Obanta came to him (Elese) for the installation rites were  Oba Adenuga Folagbade, who reigned from November 10, 1925 to February 4, 1929.
Others were Oba Alli Ogunaike Fibiwoga, who reigned between April 27, 1929 to 1933 and Oba Daniel Robertson Adesanya  Gbelegbuwa, from 1933 to 1959. 

The immediate past Awujale, Oba Sikiru Kayode Adetona, (Ogbagba II) who ascended the throne  in 1960, but joined his ancestors on July 13, 2025 also came to Oba Adenle for the installation rites.
There are many other installation rites that an Awujale-elect must undergo before his official installation and coronation.

Time will tell whether the next Awujale, be he Christian or Muslim would observe these important rites!
