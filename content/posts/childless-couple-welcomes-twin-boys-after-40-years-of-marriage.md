A 75-year-old pastor and his 63-year-old wife have become proud parents of twin baby boys after four decades of waiting.
This neighbours, worshippers, and residents of Mowe-Ofada, Ogun State, have described as nothing short of “the miracle of the century.”

Pastor James and Mrs. Janet Ajibola, founders of the popular Super JJJ School and ministers at the Christ Apostolic Church (CAC), Purity and Power Zone, Mowe, were blessed with twin sons, Joshua and James, after 40 years of marriage.


The couple, who had endured years of prayers, faith, and social pressure, held a joyous naming ceremony on Saturday that drew a massive crowd from far and near.

Witnesses described the event as “a celebration like no other,” with people struggling for space inside and outside the church premises.

According to attendees, food and drinks flowed freely in an atmosphere of unrestrained joy.

What made the celebration even more remarkable was the presence of Muslim leaders who joined in the thanksgiving, repeatedly shouting “Allahu Akbar!” in praise of God’s wonder.

An attendee, who spoke with Newsmakerslive.org, said many guests had come simply to verify what they thought was a rumour.

“People just wanted to see for themselves if it was true,” she said. “But it was and everyone went home praising God. The couple’s faith has been rewarded in a way that words can hardly describe.”

In what further astonished the community, sources close to the family confirmed that the birth did not involve any medical intervention, surgery, or IVF procedure, and that the twins were delivered naturally within two hours.

For decades, the Ajibolas had been pillars of faith and education in their community, running their school and church with deep conviction despite their personal pain.

The long-awaited arrival of their twin sons, Joshua and James, has now turned their home into a place of pilgrimage for those seeking proof that, as the Bible says, “with God, nothing shall be impossible.”
