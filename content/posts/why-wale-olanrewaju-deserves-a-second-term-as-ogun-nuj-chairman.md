ABEOKUTA– Before December 22nd, 2022, the Ogun state Council of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) was plagued by a self inflicted 3years crisis.


The crisis, arising from leadership tussle from an inconclusive elections, courts injunctions, counter court orders and judgement however reached its crescendo in 2022.


The members having lost so much decided to come together and chart a new course for the Union.
The national leadership, with other veterans from the state ensured an hitch free electioneering process which later produced a duly elected executives, accepted by all and sundry.


The Wale Olanrewaju led exco’s will be winding down it’s activities by December, 2025. Therefore, a new process of electioneering will kick start in earnest to usher in a new leadership to pilot the affairs of the state council for another 3 years.


Constitutional provision however offers members or elected executive an opportunity for a two term of 3 years each, which therefore means the Wale Olanrewaju led administration is entitled to one, if not why not.
The adage that says one good turn deserves another means an assessment of WaleCentrism (as fondly called in his students unionism era) led exco is necessary to determine if its good turn, truly deserves another.
A union coming out of crisis, one would say needs a stabilizer, a father figure at the centre that can holds the other units (chapels) together as a uniting body.


The Journey so far….


The Wale Olanrewaju led executive has however lived above board securing the union a brand new 18 seater union bus (brand new) donated by the Ogun state governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun. 
The Wale led exco, through a well thought ingenuity have also resuscitated the old bus from the brim of neglect. The two buses are well and running.


The remodelling of the Iwe Iroyin secretariate of the union, making the once colonial edifice a beauty, worthy of the profession cannot be weaved away. The facelift has been described by many as the 8th wonder of the nation’s NUJ Secretariates.


Water, they say is life. Today, the secretariat is enjoying water supplies from its first ever functinal borehole, sunked from the exco’s ingenuity, despite paucity of funds.


A 12kva solar power system, donated by Senator Shauib Afolabi Salisu (Senator representating Ogun Central) has therefore turned the secretariat into a 24-hour power city.


Members' welfare, the bone of unionism also took centre stage in the administration as distribution of monetary interventions, laptops, grounding machines, and sewing machines, amongst others items have assisted to generate income for beneficiaries.


From 8 chapels council, the Wale Olarenwaju led exco has been able to increase chapels to 15, thereby competing favourably with other councils across the country.


In two and the half years, the Wale Olarenwaju led exco has been able to impart members directly. This is a break-away from past norms where beneficiaries of council’s largesse are hardly known.


Worthy of note is the reclaiming of the permanent site of the union located at a prime area in Lemme, Abeokuta. This landed property has been undeveloped by previous administrations since 1986 when it was given to the union by the government.


 Today, a solar powered borehole donated by Senator Adeola Olamilekan Solomon, (Senator representing Ogun West) has been sunked and working perfectly at the site.


Press Week, a weeklong activities for journalists to unwind, interacts and network has been organized without any break. This is what other councils have not find easy to organise yearly. Kudos to all sponsors and committee members who have ensured a yearly event till date.


These and many more achievements this space and memory may not allow me signifies a pragmatic leadership and focus led administration which in all honesty deserves a second try.
Do you think he deserves a second term?
