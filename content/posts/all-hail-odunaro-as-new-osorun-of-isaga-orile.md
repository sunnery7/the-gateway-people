All roads literarily led to Isaga-Orile, in Abeokuta North Local Government Area of Ogun State on Saturday as Chief Kayode Odunaro, the Chief of Staff and Media Adviser to Senator Solomon Olamilekan Adeola,(a.Kingdom.a.Yayi) was installed the Osorun of the town.
The installation was performed by the Onisaga of Isaga-Orile Kingdom, Oba Joseph Oladele Olusoji Tella and attended by dignitaries as well as family members and others.
There has been long interregnum following the passage of Odunaro's uncle who last occupied the kingmaker's position.
Fielding questions after the installation, Odunaro described the installation as a great honour as well as home-coming and fulfillment of ancestral responsibility

Odunaro who said the Osorun title is hereditary within his family added that his installation marks the continuation of a long-standing lineage role.

“I am delighted that I have just been installed as the Osorun of Isaga-Orile Kingdom. This is a very important traditional title in the kingdom as Osorun is one of the kingmakers".

“The title belongs to our family; my late uncle was installed in 1958 and held the title till he passed on in 1988. So, for decades, there was a vacancy in the position of Osorun.
" Therefore, I am highly elated that I am filling the vacant position today after so many years of interregnum.”
"For me, it is a higher call to traditional responsibility and I will ensure that I bring experiences I garnered over the years as spokesperson of three administrations, both military and civilian in Ogun, to bear in this new title."

“As I have done in public service, I will use this Osorun title to contribute to the growth and development of the Isaga-Orile Kingdom.”

 A seasoned journalist and former Chief Press Secretary to ex-Ogun State governor, Aremo Olusegun Osoba, assured that his  new role will enable him to contribute meaningfully to the traditional development of Isaga-Orile.

Oba Tella, while performing the installation, commended the Odunaro family for preserving their heritage and charged him to uphold the dignity of the stool.

“The Osorun stool is one of the most respected positions among the kingmakers in our kingdom. It is a position of trust and service. 
"I am happy the family has restored their ancestral role. I have confidence in Chief Kayode Odunaro to perform his duties diligently,” the monarch stated.

A member of the Isaga-Orile Traditional Council, Chief Adebayo Akinyemi, expressed joy at the revival of the title, describing Odunaro as a worthy son of the soil.

“Chief Odunaro has made us proud in the public space, and we believe his wealth of experience will reflect positively on our traditional council,” Akinyemi stated.
The new Osorun, who is also the  Baroyin of Imala, has also been honoured with a chieftaincy title by the paramount ruler of Yewa land, Oba Kehinde Olugbenle.
