Every  March 18 of every year is a special day in our family as it marks the anniversary of my mother’s coming 

into this world.

This year’s own is significant because it is my mum’s 60th birthday and she is alive, healthy, active and in

her sound mind…. Alhamdulillah!

So, because it’s her birthday, it’s my pleasure to use this platform to say a few words of thanks to my mother, Chief Mrs. Olori Monsurat Abeke, (aka Mummy Tee-jay).

Today I thank my mother for the wonderful example she has set for me.

Mum, by your example you have demonstrated to me how a good mother can juggle both works and nurturing a family all while being an exceptional and loving wife in the process.

Mum, thank you for the good example you set as a wife.

Today, I also want to thank my mother for the wonderful example she sets for me as a mother.

Mum, by your example, you have demonstrated to me how a woman can seek to honor God in her  role as a caring mother, love and care for her children, teach them the importance of maximizing  their educational opportunities, support their gifts, talents, abilities, hopes and dreams, impart 

Godly wisdom, demonstrate Godly character and principles, share what you’ve learned about  people and life, show them how to stand on their own feet, be there for them as best you can in times of trouble, and become a friend to them in their adult years.

Mum, thank you for the good example you set as a mother.

She taught me right from wrong and made me into the person I am today. The ability to judge right from wrong, is one of the many presents granted to me by my mom. There is no amount of words 

that can express the gratitude I have for everything she did and still is doing each day. I sincerely  appreciate all of your sacrifices for me. I'll try my utmost to ensure that those sacrifices were not 

in vain. I love you more than words can express, and I hope you will stay with us for a long time. I will do everything in my power to ensure that you have every ounce of happiness in the world.

Happy birthday to the best mother that one could possibly ask for!

I rejoice with my mum @ 60!

My dear mum, every  March 18 is your day which is why on this special day, I want to express my deepest gratitude for everything you've done for me and for the unwavering love and support you've always shown.

From the earliest days of my childhood to the present, you've been my rock and my guiding light. Your unconditional love has been a constant source of strength, encouraging me to pursue my dreams and become the person I am today. Whether it was staying up late to help me with homework or offering a shoulder to lean on during tough times, you've always been there for me, without hesitation or reservation.

Your guidance and availability has been filled with countless precious moments. Each memory is a testament to the love and kindness you have shown me.

Your kindness, generosity, and selflessness inspire me to be a better person every day. Your wisdom and guidance have shaped my values and taught me the importance of empathy, compassion, and resilience. You've instilled in me a love for life and a belief in the power of perseverance, qualities that I hold dear and carry with me always.

As you celebrate another year of life, my wish for you is simple;  may your days be filled with joy, laughter, and the love of family and friends. May you continue to inspire others with your warmth and kindness, and may you always know how deeply you are loved and appreciated.

Happy birthday and happy retirement, Mum. Thank you for being the most incredible mother a child could ever ask for.

Celebrating Mom!

On this special day, we honour the incredible woman who fills our lives with love, warmth, and wisdom—our beloved mom. 

Her kindness and care make our home a haven, and her support helps us grow strong. She's not just a mom; she's a friend, a mentor, and a guiding light.

Mom's love knows no bounds. She's always there to lend a hand, offer a listening ear, or share a comforting hug. Her generosity touches everyone she meets, showing us the true meaning of compassion and generosity.

Today, as we celebrate her birthday, let's take a moment to thank her for everything she does. Mom, you're the heart of our family, and we're so grateful for you. Happy Birthday!
