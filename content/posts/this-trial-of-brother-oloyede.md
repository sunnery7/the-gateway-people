It’s been traumatic for my entire family since that video started making the rounds. I sneaked a slight view. It’s our trial. It’s my trial. Oloyede is genuine. He is most sincere. He is modestly so as well. For us, however, Allah knows best.

I was with a trader in the afternoon of what I considered a dark Wednesday, the 14th of May 2025. “Se bi won ni JAMB o get mo bayi…”.

I had to cut in immediately. Which JAMB? “Madam, that’s one person I will vouch, and vouch for…zero tolerance for corruption. Absolutely responsible with a high level of consciousness for the good of others. If certain things went wrong at JAMB, I agree it’s his responsibility to carry all pleasant and other burdens but just know that the bad side of the operations may as well be sabotage. I have absolute trust in that man. Ask my own colleagues about me, but Oloyede is my own hero, somebody I have known for more than 40 years…”

This is by no means a reductionist disposition to the tragedy induced by  the so called computer glitch. May the Almighty God in His infinite mercy console the parents of the candidate reported to have committed suicide. May God strengthen them to survive this gloomy phase of their lives and sustain them to reap bounteous compensation that will endure in their lives. It’s hard, so hard to  pull tragedies of this magnitude. I personally feel for these parents.

The said computer glitch thing, may we never fall victim of it. Those who work for big organisations requiring large layout of ICT operations know what I’m talking about.  Rather than being solutionist, IT facilities can be unimaginably problematic sometimes, yet indispensable in this civilizational dispensation?

This is not doubting deliberate sabotage as may have happened in the case of JAMB. I’ve been part of the Oloyede’s JAMB journey to attest to his commitment to offer his best for the otherwise sinking board.

Far from being cosmetically exhibitionist, the Oloyede-led JAMB team led the Education Minister, Tunji Alausa, round the critical facilities of JAMB during the just concluded examination. Alausa saw firsthand, like never before elsewhere in this country, how far JAMB had gone in its strive for transparency and real time monitoring of the conduct of examinations nationwide. Alausa, beyond being in awe sought to make the JAMB effect spread immediately to other examination bodies.

No be dem say, same day, the WAEC team came to JAMB and made it into the situation room which was my own duty post. The NECO team followed suit afterwards, both duly led around by the sturdy lead IT consultant who’s been reliably there from Oloyede’s assumption of duty, Damilola Bamiro. Far richer, given that they charge more for their exams, the duo of WAEC and NECO were suddenly mandated to understudy the exam sector leader in Africa that JAMB has become over time.

The staff of both WAEC and NECO suddenly had to undertake a professional excursion led through all the real time monitoring screens and other digital facilities.  It was obvious they marveled at what they saw revealing functional leader-subordinate synergy manifest with trendy output that the world can see and learn from.

But that may even seem the tip of the iceberg of the output of the hardwork and commitment of the nation’s foremost icon of integrity in public service.  Series of far more seemingly serious strides had  been accomplished by Oloyede at JAMB. As a focused scholar, he keeps ensuring that every bit of the experience of the Board is treasured as worthy data to guide future actions and even subjects for further research.

Not even the agencies dedicated to emergency matters in Nigeria could have been as prompt as the Oloyede management on this ugly glitch saga. Once the complainants began ventilating into the public space, JAMB rose to the challenge without any predictably traditional arrogant stance of government is always right.

I was aware that a particularly strident public critic and a former  Students leader at Obafemi Awolowo University, Adeola Soetan commended the spokesperson for JAMB for excellent handling of public complaints.

Promptly, an independent team of investigators was set up to unravel the mystery leading to the rather depressing situation that now confronts us.  The team, drawn from assorted but technically relevant constituencies, has found out that no fewer than 165 centres of over 800  exam centres nationwide were affected. Obviously well prepared for whatever the outcome may turn out to be, he braced up to the challenge to embrace the surrender value to tell it to the world as it is.

This trial is for all of us who believe and trust Oloyede. I am incrovertibly in this group. So much so that  his public cry infected me…It was a patriot’s cry for his beloved country.  Like me, a former Law don at LASU, Dr Kilani wasn’t any less affected as demonstrated in a quick note to me: I wite to associate myself with the pain, sorrow and emotion of our own Professor Oloyede. I could not hold my tears seeing him cry. May Almighty Allah see him through. May we all not be put to shame…”

But then came a soothing message from Gbade Osunsoko, my cousin: “…He will come out of this much stronger because Nigerians will trust him far better than a number of our leaders..  A man that mistakes happen under him and takes responsibility-it’s a big deal in Nigeria”

With Oloyede, young Nigerians with challenges regarding sight are no longer left to moan their fate endlessly with adequate provision for their inclusion in the UTME. How many of our public facilities are this inclusion conscious as stipulated by SDGs?.

How come a legacy built through almost a decade at the very best cost ever possible will be made to crumble when the game changer leader yet remains ever modest? JAMB has steadily risen through thick and thin to accomplish her tasks to the admiration of stakeholders nationally and internationally under Oloyede.

Both NNPC and the Nigeria Police, being beneficiaries, can attest to the current competence of JAMB. How much more of other numerous stakeholders nationwide never deemed to have any relevance to JAMB before Oloyede but have since become critical, if not indispensable players?

But why this sudden saddening encounter threatening our joy of service without blemish? Why this unforeseen truncation of a good story, so intentional, coming from Africa? Whodunnit? Surely the truth shall come out for the world to perceive and assess and get to appreciate the efforts and the quantum of commitment appropriated to the JAMB excellence project driven by Oloyede.

One cannot but be deeply concerned.  Before the very eyes of a few of us carefully selected to give support from our respective professional perspectives from the very beginning, Professor Oloyede’s concern for genuine growth and development was real.  It is still reall and ind increasingly so, as a matter of fact. Indeed, inimitable. It shall be well.
