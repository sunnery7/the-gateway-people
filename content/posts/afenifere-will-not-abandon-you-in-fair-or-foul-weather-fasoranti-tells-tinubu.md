The entire leadership of Afenifere is happy to be here at the centre of Nigerian power, Aso Rock Villa, to meet with our son, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the first member of Afenifere to be elected the President of Nigeria.  



We are delighted, Mr President, with what you are doing for our country and we assure you of our continuing support.



We thank you for your visit to us in Akure February 28, 2024, and we believe it is right and proper and in line with Yoruba tradition, that we should reciprocate your kind gesture.



We appreciate this relationship and we need to make it work in the interest of Nigeria and the larger world of Africa and Africa in the Diaspora.



Mr President, you are the leader of Nigeria now and the most important political figure in the Black World.



We expect you, knowing your pedigree and the legacy that you represent, to lead our country with courage, knowledge and integrity.  



We have no doubt that your tenure would mark a turning-point in the history of Nigeria when our great country, under your able leadership, would be re-positioned for greatness.



We would like to call Your Excellencyâ€™s attention to certain issues.



RESRUCTURING OF THE FEDERATION



During the march to independence, our leaders agreed on the Independence Constitution which allowed each of the three regions to have its own constitution. 



 This constitution got terminated in 1966 following the first military coup that ended the First Republic. Now, we have to deal with the reality that we have 36 states and not three or four regions.  



Nonetheless, we would want you to lead the efforts to amend the present constitution to reflect the agreement of our leaders and founding fathers of our Republic.  



The six geo-political zones now being used for certain decisions, already point to a future regional arrangement for our country.  



We look into a future when more powers and responsibilities are devolved to the states so that our citizens can benefit more from a more equitable federalism.  



We take special note that restructuring of the federation is one a major item of your party, the All-Progressives Congress, APC.



INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE SOUTH WEST



We congratulate Your Excellency on the massive reconstruction of the Third Mainland Bridge in Lagos and the excellent work done on the Lagos-Ibadan Express Road. 



We also want Your Excellency to look into the state of all the Federal Highways in the South-West including the Ibadan to Ife, Akure to Ado Ekiti and Osogbo to Ibadan and Akinfosile-Igbotako Road. We need the dualization of Ore-Ondo-Akure-Owo-Benin Road. Almost all these roads need urgent and comprehensive Federal attention.  



Many of these roads require not just repairs, but total rehabilitations.  We need a special attention on the deplorable state of the Ibadan-Ife-Ondo Road which links the political capital of Yorubaland with the source.



One major project that would benefit not just the South-West, but the entire country, is a rail-link between Lagos and Abuja.  This would be a great legacy project for Your Excellency for your consideration and implementation.



SECURITY



Afenifere is in support of the campaign for state police.  We believe this would enhance the security of life and property.  



We also want Your Excellency to look at the command structures of Federal Security agencies to ensure equity and justice in the posting and deployments of senior officers.  



Equity should also reflect in the recruitment of security officers from the bottom up.  It is not good for the future of our country if one section of it has some of the security agencies in its pocket.



EMPLOYMENT



Unemployment has become a big burden for our country where we have more than 70 percent of the population below the age of 30.  



We would like to appeal that Federal Government capital projects, including road construction, should be geared towards creating employments.  



This is necessary because it is becoming increasingly fashionable for politicians to prefer foreign companies to carry out jobs that can be competently done by Nigerian companies. 



For example, if Nigerians cannot build train engines, we can at least start from building train coaches!



If Mr President would allow us, we would submit proposal for employment using the existing artisans throughout the country to institute a national apprenticeship training system that would take millions of youths from the street.



SPECIAL REQUEST



We would like to appeal to Your Excellency to approve the upgrading of the Federal College of Agriculture, Kabba, in Kogi State into a full-fledge federal university.  



The college is one of the oldest tertiary institutions in Nigeria. It was one of the five Colleges of Agriculture created when the Ahmadu Bello, University, Zaria, was established in 1963. 



 Fifty-nine years later, each of the other four colleges have been upgraded into Federal University.  The only exception is Kabba.  We hereby appeal to Your Excellency to change the fortune of this old institution by upgrading it to a university.



CONCLUSION



We commend Your Excellency on the prompt action in signing the Students Loan Act.  



We implore that this should be operationalise soonest.  It is an indication of your unwavering to the legacy bequeathed to us by our leader and sage, Chief Obafemi Awolowo on the centrality of education to human development. 



 We affirm that we will stand by you as you make all efforts to change the Nigerian story for the better.  Be assured that Afenifere would not abandon you in fair or foul weather as long as you remain faithful to the principles of integrity, fairness, competence and courage that we expect of you as the Leader of our Republic.  



 All the leaders and elders of Yorubaland are with you.  All our mothers and youths are standing by you as you carry out this your historic assignment.  



Now that we have fulfilled our promise to visit you, note that as we depart, our goodwill and prayers will always be with you. You have started well.  



God will grant you the capacity and wisdom to serve Nigeria well during your first and second terms.



Thanks, Your Excellency, for your time and attention.
