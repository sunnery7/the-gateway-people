In every sense of history, the 10th Alake and Paramount ruler of Egbaland Oba Adedotun Aremu Gbadebo, Okukenu IV is very unique.



He is not only the first university degree holder to occupy the exalted seat of his forebears, but his tenure has witnessed tremendous developments.



Oba Gbadebo joined the Army after a degree from the Faculty of Arts from the Nigeria's  premier university, the University of Ibadan. 



Before he left the Army as a Colonel, he was said to have worked as Principal Staff Officer to the late Chief of Staff, Supreme Headquarters, Brigadier Tunde Idiagbon. 



The retired Army Colonel, Oba Gbadebo, was not only born in Abeokuta, but grew up in the ancient town of Abeokuta where he had his primary and secondary education.



Growing up as a child, Alake, son of sanitary inspector knew and still knows the inside out of the Egba town from Wasinmi-Ake, his father's residence where he interacted with his playmates



Among Oba Gbadebo's childhood friends who celebrated with the royal father when he marked his 80th birthday anniversary last month is Nigerian turbine engineer and Asiwaju of Irolu-Remo, Sir (Engr.) Abayomi Ebenezer Awodipe.



Felicitating the eminent royal Egba monarch, Awodipe remembers with nostalgia their youthful and playful days at "Baba Wole-Wole's" house.



"Kabiyesi, on the occassion of your 80th birthday, I celebrate our togetherness,  I celebrate friendship among other qualities of yours"



"Long may you live on the throne of your fore fathers. I thank God for making it possible for us to still be alive to celebrate ourselves".
