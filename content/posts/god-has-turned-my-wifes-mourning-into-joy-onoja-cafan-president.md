For the National President of the Catfish Farmers Association of Nigeria, CAFAN, Mr. Sunday Onoja today is the day the Lord has made and he will not only rejoice, but he will be glad indeed as well as also celebrates it!.
Onoja's wife of almost 25 years was recently blessed by God with a bouncing baby girl after waiting  on the Lord for decades!


Sharing the good news with CAFAN members through their whatsapp platforms, the Kogi- born celebrated and nationally acclaimed catfish entrepeneur confessed that he had been privately wiping away tears these past years.


She described the mother of his new baby girl as a believer in God, a wonderful wife, and a loving friend with quiet character.


His words:"She has painfully and patiently waited upon the good Lord to keep His eternal promise that none shall be barren in the land".


According to Onoja, despite her wife waiting on the Lord,"she trained and nurtured his second wife's five children, three boys and two girls as if they were her biological children".


Urging people to help him thank God and appreciate his wives for their pure and uncommon loves, Onoja said: "second wonderful wife of 22 years will give birth and handover the baby to the first wife without any fear of harm or jealousy".


Since the marriages of almost 25 and 22 years respectively, Onoja disclosed:"it has been pure love among these great wonderful wives that God has given me".


He added: "I am the only one that knows the magnitude of joy on this occassion. I can confidently look at my wife's eyes and see no strain of tears' bubs of years of secret tears".
"God has turned my wife's mourning into joy and dancing. She is a rare woman and wife that every man should always pray to have as a wife".


Onoja, who says it is good to have a good mother-in-law, appreciated his almost 80 years old mother.
"My mother of almost 80 years is my wife's prayer partner and came to carry the results of the prayers for her grand daughter.  


"She never put my wife under pressure once despite the fact that I have five children already. Rather she keeps assuring her that she will sorely one day carry her own one day. This is that day!"he enthused
