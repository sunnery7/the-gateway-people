Inna Lillahi wa Inna Ilayhi Raji'un  (Indeed, we belong to Allah, and indeed, to Him we shall return.)  
Announcement of the Passing of Alhaji Abdulraheem Olatunde Ayinde Oladunjoye  
It is with deep sorrow and total submission to the divine will of Almighty Allah that we announce the passing of our beloved father, husband, brother, and esteemed leader, Alhaji Abdulraheem Olatunde Ayinde Oladunjoye, who returned to his Lord on Friday, 4th April 2025.  


A man of exceptional honour, integrity, and boundless kindness, Alhaji Oladunjoye was a pillar of strength, wisdom, and unwavering faith. His life was a testament to selfless service, as he touched countless lives through his generosity, humility, and dedication to uplifting others. Beyond being a devoted family man, he was a father figure to many—loved, respected, and admired by all who had the privilege of knowing him.  


His passing leaves a profound void in our family, the community of Ijebu-Itele, and the entire Ogun State, where his leadership and benevolence left an indelible mark. While we grieve his departure, we take solace in the exemplary life he lived—a life of purpose, impact, and devotion to the well-being of others.  


We humbly beseech Almighty Allah (SWT) to forgive his shortcomings, grant him the highest abode in Al-Jannah Firdaus, and grant the family and all who mourn him the fortitude to bear this irreplaceable loss. Kindly remember him in your prayers.  
Janazah (funeral) arrangements will be communicated in due course.

May his noble soul rest in perfect peace.
