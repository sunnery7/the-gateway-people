It was a new dawn in Akinale, an Owu community in Ewekoro Local Government Area of Ogun State on Monday, July 7, 2025 as Oba Oluseyi Adewole Adediran received staff of office and instrument of appointment.

Oba Adediran succeeded the late Public Relations impresairo and veteran journalist, Oba (Dr.) Olufemi Ogunleye, who joined his ancestors on June 19, 2024, few months to his 80th birthday.

The presentation by the Ogun State governor,  Prince Dapo Abiodun officially confirmed Oba Adediran as the new Towulade of Owu Akinale.

Represented by the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Ganiyu Hamzat, the governor described the ascension of Oba Adediran as historic.

While commending the peaceful and transparent selection process that produced Oba Adediran, the governor beseeched the monarch to regard his appointment as a call to serve.

“I am confident that you will concentrate on accelerating socio-economic development in Akinale and Egbaland. I implore you to mobilise your people to complement our administration’s ‘Building Our Future Together’ agenda".

While eferencing the Ogun State Anti-Land Grabbing Law, Abiodun warned against illegal land dealings.

He warned, “Our government does not only frown at land-grabbing activities but detests the involvement of any Kabiyesi in such acts. I advise our new Kabiyesi to ensure measures are in place to prevent such criminalities.”

The governor expressed gratitude to the Alake and Paramount Ruler of Egbaland, HRM Oba Adedotun Gbadebo, for his support and blessing in the emergence of the new monarch.

In his remarks, the Executive Chairman of Ewekoro Local Government, Adesina Adisa, described the event as a new dawn for the town.

“I appeal to all the people of Akinale, both at home and in the diaspora, to rally round the new Kabiyesi. Where there is unity, there will be progress.

“I say congratulations to Kabiyesi, Oba (Dr.) Oluwaseyi Adediran, on his well-deserved ascension. May your reign be peaceful, fruitful, and long,” he said.

Oba Adediran, in his acceptance speech expressed gratitude to the state government, the kingmakers, and the Akinale community for the trust reposed in him.

“I accept this huge responsibility. I’m quite ready. Akinale is not my project; it’s everybody’s project. The level of our unity will determine the level of our success,” the monarch said.

While appreciating the Olowu of Owu, Oba (Prof.) Saka Adeola Matemilola, Otileta VI and  former President Olusegun Obasanjo and Oba Gbadebo for their supports, Oba Adediran said: "I remain grateful to the governor, and I’m still expecting a lot from him"., he said
