"Motherhood is full of joy, fear and anticipation. But with the establishment of the group, members have been testifying to a smooth motherhood journey.



"Building a healthy nation starts with taking care of our young ones, both mothers and their babies long before, during and after pregnancy. This is one of the objectives of the forum so as to ensure healthy families" Mrs. Fatoki stated.



The theme of the anniversary, "Building a Healthy Nation" attracted health and medical experts, dieticians and others.

The aged also counselled the young mothers not to be harsh with domestic staff of their husbands like drivers, security guards, cleaners among others. 



Her words: "No matter the social status of your husbands, please do not allow it to get into your heads so much that it will bring conflict of interest between you, husbands and their aides



"Also do not be carried away by the affluence and wealth of your husband. Always refrain from discussing your family issues with the so called family friends as such is capable of destroying your homes"



While sharing her experiences in cooking foods with required nutritional value and content which will led to couples living a healthy life, Mrs. Obasanjo urged mothers to embrace African delicacies which she said are rich in vitamins, proteins and other basic nutrients that mothers and their babies need.

Mrs. Opaleye, who also stressed the importance of home keeping, enjoined young mothers not to allow external influence into their marriage.



While commending the passion of Mrs Fatoki towards the group, she urged her not to relent, saying that it would go places.



Hon. Fatoki, who said tolerance, understanding and fidelity are some of the tools that keep marriage going, urged members of the forum not to always leave aside prayer.



"Prayer is key to many things in life , including happy marriage. Let's keep our home going through prayer and love. Let us continue to cherish and sustain how we met. Let us continue to show love and affection as well as respect each other. We are meant for each other".



"Couples should learn how to live with one another no matter the situation they initially find themselves.

She gave tips on what young mothers could do when their babies or infants faint, suffer nose bleed, sustain fracture or ingest poisonous substance and other various degrees of injuries. 



Yusuf,  who  urged mothers to always consider hospital as next necessary option after first aid treatment, frowned at self medication.  



According to her, toddlers and infants are prone to getting head bumps while growing and this unfortunate incident may happen under the watchful eyes of mothers.



"Such a bump may be minor or serious. Which everone, the brain of a child  just like the older ones is very important. If anything untold happens to the head and unfortunately affects the brain, if the person, whether young or old did not die, he or she may live with the disability arising from such an accident for life. So, we need to take care of our babies".



"Animals, including snakes, or insects and scorpion bites which are very common domestic emergencies at homes must be prevented on our babies as their consequences are usually grevious".



"I also appeal to you mothers to avoid dog bites on our babies as its treatment is usually expensive. As mothers, we should be extra careful and avoid a situation where our babies were beaten by a dog". 



"Although we do not pray for it, but when it happens, we must not hesitate to seek immediate  medical attention. I also advise against over-the-counter medication for our babies"



"Any victim of the above emergencies should not be treated with first aid, but rather medical attention in an hospital to prevent aggravation of the situation".



"There are many other emergencies from homes that regretably even claim the lives of young ones and these emergencies occurred as a result of negligence of mothers".



"Fall is very common in many homes by children. As a result of this, they sustain fracture in parts of their bodies. 



Another common accident that requires emergency is drowning. "Most mothers that store water in big homes, large bowls and others when children start to walķ would not know when their babies find their ways into the danger zone".



She also gave other tips on healthy living not only by mothers, but by their babies too.



Mrs. Olubunmi Oshineye in her lecture which centred on how to promote fertility, enjoined mothers not to joke with it as it is the bedrock of producing healthy babies.



"As females, we should not be concerned with our fertility only after marriage, but right from our adolescence as many would-be mothers damage their fertility long before marriage".



She lamented that many females are not getting it right in their bid to have babies as they arbitrarily abstain from regular sexual intercourse with their husbands.



"You can't prove your fertility when you are running away from sexual intercourse with your husband. No amount of prayers will make you a mother when your are running away from

this basic steps towards bearing a child". 



For would-be mothers,  Mrs. Oshineye while charging them to eat healthý diets also appeals to them to take advantage of their monthly ovulation circles which she said is a surest period of getting pregnant.



She also disclosed that fertility was not limited to women alone, adding that research had shown that many men also suffered infertility problems which could be solved through medical attention.



"When we talk about the issue of fertility, women alone are not responsible as research has shown that men too have crucial role to play", she concluded.



In her own lecture titled:"First 1000 days of life", Mrs.Olufunmilola Adekunle, an Assistant Director of Nursing Services at the Federal Medical Centre, Abeokuta described the days as a very unique period.



According to her, the 1000 days include the period of pregnancy as well as the first two years of the baby.



Adekunle added that the period is also when the foundation of good health growth and neurological development for the entire life span of such a child are established.



"This period strongly determines an infant brain health and the achievement of age related developmental milestone", she stated.
