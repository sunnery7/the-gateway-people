Ijebu – Ode: It is raining at the Aafin Awujale of Ijebuland in Ijebu Ode. The rain is the rain of brand new vehicles; SUVs, buses and cars that the longest reigning first class monarch in Nigeria, Kabiyesi Alayeluwa Oba (Dr.) Sikiru Kayode Adetona GCON, the Awujale and Paramount Ruler of Ijebuland, has been giving out, all-expenses-paid, to his people in the last three months or so.

At the last count, Kabiyesi Awujale who is also the President of the Ijebu Traditional Council (IT), has given out over ten vehicles, including GAC GS4, GAC GS3, GAC buses and GAC Saloon cars, whose total value is well over half a billion naira.             
Just last week, another set of three beneficiaries got three brand news GAC GS3 SUVs from the 91 years old monarch, renowned for mind-blowing philanthropy, principled pro- democracy disposition and public spiritedness.

The latest beneficiaries are the Secretary of Committee on Creation of Ijebu State, Professor (Mrs.) Bilesanmi Awoderu, who has served in the capacity for over 15 years. The second and third in command to the Chief Imam of Ijebu land also went home with brand new GAC GS3 latest editions.

Before the latest beneficiaries, the Chief Imam of Ijebu Igbo, the Chief Imam of Ijebu Ode, the Secretary of ITC, Secretary of the Regberegbe Age-groups, the Kakanfo Awujale and the Onigegewura of Ijebuland have all benefitted from the Kabiyesi

In recent past, Oba Awujale, well known for his pro-people stance on national issues and governance, constructed a modern and befitting Vice-Chancellor’s lodge at the Olabisi Onabanjo University (OOU), Ago-Iwoye. 
He also constructed a luxurious accommodation for the Director General of Sikiru Adetona Institute of Governance, which he had earlier endowed with half a billion naira. The Director General also got an SUV, while his salary and emoluments are paid by the Awujale, independent of the university.

Not done yet, the highly respected monarch who will clock 91 on May 10 this year, single-handled donated two buildings for the Institute of Governance at the Olabisi Onabanjo University valued at One Billion Naira.

President Tinubu, last year, during the celebration of the 90th birthday and 64th coronation anniversaries of the monarch, granted Awujale’s School of Governance, Ago Iwoye, the status of a full campus of the National Institute of Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS).
