The passing of a righteous individual like Princess Khadijat Adebisi Edionseri, fondly known as Cash Madam, is a profound loss to the Muslim, business, and socialite communities. According to Islamic belief, the death of a righteous person is a significant event, as it marks the transition of a soul from worldly life to the afterlife, where they will be rewarded for their good deeds.



Princess Khadijat Adebisi Edionseri was a devoted religious fellow, a great mother, a successful businesswoman, and a socialite who left an indelible mark on the lives of those who knew her. As the Iya Suna of Egbaland, Yewaland, and Ogun State, she was a respected figure in her community, known for her forthright, tenacious, loving, generous, and devoted nature.



One of her last public appearances was on Sunday, December 29, 2024, at the installation of Muslim Chiefs in Ayetoro, Yewa North Local Government, a fitting tribute to her enduring legacy. She passed away on January 5, 2025, leaving behind a void that will be deeply felt by her family, friends, and community.



Ambassador Sarafa Tunji Isola OFR, Baba Adinni of Ogun State, mourns the passage of this great mother, saying, "May Allah grant her aljanat fridaus and give the entire Muslim Community and business circle the fortitude to bear the loss."
