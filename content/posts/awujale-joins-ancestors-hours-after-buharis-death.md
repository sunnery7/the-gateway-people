**The paramount ruler of Ijebuland, Oba (Dr.) Sikiru Kayode Adetona, the Awujale and spiritual head of Ijebu people, has joined his ancestors  at the age of 91.**

The revered monarch, who reigned for over six decades, reportedly joined his ancestors  on Sunday, July 13, 2025, just hours after the announcement of the death of his longtime friend and Nigeria’s former president, Muhammadu Buhari.

The late Awujale, who ascended the throne in 1960, was widely regarded as one of Nigeria’s most influential and longest-serving traditional rulers.

He was not only a monarch but a symbol of cultural pride, political wisdom, and royal integrity.

PLATFORM TIMES reports that his death marks the end of an era for the Ijebu kingdom and traditional rulership in Nigeria.

Though official confirmation from the Ogun State Government and the Awujale’s palace was yet to be made public at press time, multiple sources close to the royal family confirmed the monarch died peacefully at a private hospital in Lagos.

Oba Adetona, a close confidant of the late President Buhari, was known for his outspoken stance on governance, national unity, and ethics in leadership.

Their decades-long friendship was rooted in mutual respect and shared conservative values, both men often seen as moral voices within their spheres.

Born on May 10, 1934, the late monarch was installed as the Awujale at just 26 years old. 

He would go on to transform Ijebuland into a beacon of peace, development, and cultural resilience. 

Under his reign, Ijebuland witnessed infrastructural growth, business expansion, and social harmony.

A first-class monarch with global recognition, Oba Adetona was instrumental in advocating constitutional roles for traditional rulers and was a strong voice during military regimes and democratic transitions.

In 2021, the Olabisi Onabanjo University renamed its School of Governance Studies in his honour—a testament to his commitment to leadership and education.

Meanwhile, tributes have started pouring in from political leaders, traditional institutions, and cultural groups across the country, describing the monarch as a rare gem and a father to many.

With the back-to-back passing of two elder statesmen—Oba Adetona and Muhammadu Buhari—within a single day, the nation enters a moment of sober reflection.

Details about burial arrangements are expected to be released by the Awujale’s Palace in Ijebu-Ode in due course.
