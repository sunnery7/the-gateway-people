My dear Bilikis Abake, today, we would have been celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary, my heart is full of both gratitude and emptiness.
Gratitude for the gift of forty beautiful years of marriage with you and emptiness that you left this world on December 4th, 2024, before we could reach this milestone together.
You were more than my wife, you were my best friend, my confidant, my safe haven, and my greatest blessing. Together, we built a life filled with love, laughter, and memories I will carry for the rest of my days.
Though you are not here beside me, I feel your presence in every memory and every quiet whisper of love that still lingers in my heart.Â 
I will always celebrate you, not only on this anniversary, but every single day I live.
Happy 40th anniversary, my love. You will always be mine forever.
