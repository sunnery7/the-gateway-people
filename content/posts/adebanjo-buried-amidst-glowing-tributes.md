Amidst glowing tributes, the late nationalist and foremost Yoruba leader, Pa Ayo Adebanjo was last Saturday buried at his hometown in Isanya-Ogbo, in Ijebu-Ode, Ogun State.

 Adebanjo, the lawyer-turned politician died at the age of 96 on February 14, 2025.

An associate of the late sage, Chief Obafemi, his remains were  buried after a funeral service held at St. Philip Anglican Church, Isanya Ogbo.

Ogun State Governor Abiodun in his remarks said: “Chief Adebanjo was a dogged fighter for true federalism. He persistently argued that Nigeria’s over-centralised system of government bred economic imbalance and ethnic tension.

“Under his leadership, Afenifere, the Pan-Yoruba socio-political group, was revitalised, becoming a potent force with democratic wisdom pushing for regional integration, restructuring, and devolution of powers.

“Beyond politics, he was deeply committed to preserving the rich Yoruba culture. He denounced nepotism, corruption, and impunity whenever they reared their ugly heads, becoming a moral compass for all.

“As Nigeria continues its walk towards democratic consolidation, the life of Chief Ayo Adebanjo remains a timeless blueprint for Nigeria—one defined by courage, conviction, and unbending integrity.

“His ideals will continue to live on in the hearts of millions, and his contributions shall serve as a path to building a just, united, and truly federal Nigeria.”

Delivering a sermon, the Archbishop of the Lagos Ecclesiastical Province of the Anglican Church and Bishop of the Remo Diocese, Bishop Michael Fape, urged Nigerians to live a life of purpose and selflessness, just like Adebanjo.

The cleric stressed that what truly matters is how individuals utilise the gift of life before the end comes.

Bishop Fape urged leaders across all levels of government to emulate the late nationalist and foremost Yoruba leader.




Prominent Nigerians and politicians, including former President Olusegun Obasanjo, immediate past Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, former presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, Governors Dapo Abiodun (Ogun), Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos) and Seyi Makinde of Oyo State attended the funeral.

Also in attendance were, former governors of Ogun State, Otunba Gbenga Daniel and Senator Ibikunle Amosun; governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Yemi Cardoso, former deputy governor of Ogun State, Senator Adegbenga Kaka, and Chief Ayo Opadokun.
