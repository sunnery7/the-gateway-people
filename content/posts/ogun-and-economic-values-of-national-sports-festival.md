Few hours to the National Sports Festival, Nigeria's finest athletes set to shine in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. The National Sports Festival is a premier multi-sport event in Nigeria that brings together athletes from across the country to compete in various disciplines. This year's edition is expected to showcase the state's hospitality and economic potential. Beyond the sporting spectacle, the festival is anticipated to have a significant impact on Ogun state's economy.

Nearly two decades after making history in 2006, Ogun State is once again taking centre stage. Back then, the Gateway Games left a lasting impression on the nation under the visionary leadership of the then Ogun State Governor, Otunba Gbenga Daniel and then Commissioner for Sports, Hon. Bukola Olopade.

The much-anticipated 22nd National Sports Festival is now at our doorsteps and excitement is reaching crescendo.

Athletes, coaches, fans, stakeholders, and sports enthusiasts across the country are gearing up for what promises to be Nigeria’s biggest sporting spectacle—the 2024 Gateway Games.

The leadership of the National Sports Commission (NSC) led by Chairman, Mallam Shehu Dikko, has been instrumental in driving the momentum and vision behind the 22nd National Sports Festival (NSF). Known for his strategic acumen and results-oriented approach, Dikko has brought his wealth of experience to mobilize resources, foster collaboration across sectors, and set clear performance benchmarks as a strong foundation for the success of the Festival.

The National Sports Festival is a testament to Ogun State's commitment to sports development. The state's government has invested heavily in sports infrastructure and programmes, promoting a healthy lifestyle among its residents.

Hosting a major event like this festival requires significant investment on infrastructure, including sports facilities, transportation, and accommodation. Ogun State has invested heavily in upgrading its infrastructure, which is expected to attract tourists and businesses to the state. This investment will not only benefit the state's economy but also enhance the quality of life for its residents.

One of the key economic benefits of hosting the NSF is the creation of jobs. The event will attract thousands of visitors, including athletes, officials, and spectators, who will require accommodation, food, transportation and other services. This will create opportunities for locals to earn a living and boost the state's economy.

The economic benefits of hosting the festival will not be limited to the duration of the event. The infrastructure developed for the festival will have a lasting impact on the state's economy, attracting investors and tourists in the long term.

The NSF will also provide a platform for Ogun State to showcase its tourism potential. The state's rich cultural heritage, beautiful landscapes, and warm hospitality make it an attractive destination for tourists. One of the centres of attraction is the newly refurbished Olumo Rock which stands as a silent witness to history, threads of tradition and woven in colour. The place is a symbol of the Egba’s history and traditional governance.

The festival will also have a positive impact on the state's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Local businesses will benefit from increased demand for goods and services, including food, beverages, and souvenirs. This will provide an opportunity for SMEs to grow and expand their businesses.

In addition to the economic benefits, the festival will also promote unity and integration among Nigerians. The event will bring together athletes and spectators from different parts of the country, fostering a sense of national identity and camaraderie.

The festival will also provide a platform for Ogun State to showcase its sporting talent. The state's athletes have been training hard to make a mark in the various disciplines, and the festival will provide them with an opportunity to shine. Kudos must be given to the Ogun state governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, CON for providing a conducive environment for the state’s athletes to prepare themselves for the festival. The athletes have no reason to fail with the high level of exposure and trial competitions provided for them by the state government.

The NSF is expected to attract significant media attention, which will promote Ogun State's image and reputation. The state's hospitality, infrastructure, and attractions will be showcased to a national and international audience, attracting potential investors and tourists.

The remodeled long-overdue MKO Abiola Sports Complex, Kuto, Abeokuta venue for the major track and field events has worn a beautiful look as the exterior and interior designs of the stadium indicate the readiness of the state government to host athletes and stakeholders in the sporting world and treat them to a wonderful time. A visit to the Alake Sports Centre in Ijeja area of Abeokuta, venue for the hosting of indoor games like squash, volleyball, basketball, handball, table tennis, badminton and other combat games, revealed that everything is in good shape and awaiting the arrival of participating teams. Thankfully, the first ever Olympics standard size swimming pool has been provided which will serve as another standing signature on infrastructural development by Prince Dapo Abiodun led administration under the I.S.E.Y.A agenda mantra of his administration.

Designated centres for economic activities have been allocated to traders in such a way that their operations will not affect the beautification of the stadium for the National Sports Festival tagged: the “Gateway Games 2024”.

By facilitating these sporting facilities, Governor Dapo Abiodun has etched his name in gold in the annal of Ogun State development. Until his recent intervention, the Ijeja Sports Complex had suffered reckless abandon under the past successive administrations in the state. The best they had ever done was seasonal painting as palliative measure.

In all of these performance indicators, Governor Dapo Abiodun has greatly improved the economic prosperity of the state. The economic value of the National Sports Festival within the two weeks duration cannot be quantified and the multiplier effect of the festival cannot be measured for the two weeks events. 

Already, before the commencement of the Nigeria’s Olympics, Ogun state is reaping the economic benefits of the sports infrastructure. Three major international events have been secured to take place at the MKO Abiola Sports Complex. The combined 3rd U18/U20 athletics championships, scheduled to hold from July 16 to 20, 2025 has also been pitched to take place at the stadium. Nigeria’s female national team, the Super Falcons will play their international friendly match against Indomitable Lionesses of Cameroon at the remodeled pitch of the MKO Abiola Sports complex on June 3rd, to prepare them for the African Women Cup of Nations (AWCON) coming up in Morocco in July. The magnificent stadium will also host the West African Football Union Zone B U-17 championship later in September, 2025. The buzzing night economy within the sprawling stadium will give life back to the once upon a time deserted abode for socialites and night rockers.

To ensure the success of the festival, Ogun State has put in place elaborate security arrangements. The state's security agencies and national security have been working tirelessly to ensure that athletes, officials, and spectators have a safe and enjoyable experience.

The National Sports Festival will also have a positive impact on the state's agriculture sector. Local farmers will benefit from increased demand for foodstuffs, which will boost their income and improve their livelihoods.

The festival will also provide an opportunity for Ogun State to showcase its entrepreneurial spirit. Local entrepreneurs will have the opportunity to showcase their products and services, attracting potential investors and partners.

The economic benefits of hosting the National Sports Festival will be felt beyond Ogun State. The event will attract visitors from across the country, promoting inter-state trade and commerce.As the countdown stops, the vibrant city of Abeokuta will come alive as top athletes from every corner of Nigeria converge for an exhilarating showcase of talent, determination, and sportsmanship. Abeokuta is ready. The athletes are ready. Mark your calendars and join the excitement as Nigeria’s sporting future unfolds.

From May 16th to 30th, 2025, the M.K.O. Abiola Sports Complex and other sports centers will transform into battlegrounds where champions are made. Whether you’re a fan of track, field, or team sports, this event promises unforgettable moments and fierce competition.Omo Ogun, Iseya.
