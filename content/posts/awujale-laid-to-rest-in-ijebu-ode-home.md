The Awujale of Ijebuland and paramount ruler of the Ijebu people, Oba Sikiru Kayode Adetona, has been buried.



The late monarch was buried on Monday at his private residence in Ijebu Ode, Ogun State.



The highly respected monarch, who died at the age of 91, was interred according to Islamic rites in a solemn, dignified ceremony attended by royal family members, Ijebu high chiefs, and prominent dignitaries from across the country.



The Minister of Marine and Blue Economy, Chief Gboyega Oyetola, and the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Dr. Tunji Bosun led the federal government delegation to the burial ceremony.



Other dignitaries at the burial of the longest reign monarch in Nigeria are former Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, his Deputy, Noimot Salako-Oyedele, Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, former Ambassador of Nigeria to the United Kingdom, Sarafa Tunji-Isola, Senators Gbenga Daniel, Solomon Olamilekan Adeola, Adegbenga Kaka, Aremo Olusegun Osoba, former Governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, was represented by his wife; Olufunso, 2023 governorship candidate in Ogun State, Oladipupo Adebutu, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, as well as representatives of League of Imams and Alfas in South West, Edo and Delta States.



Oba Adetona, who ascended the throne in 1960 at the age of 26, was widely revered for his principled leadership, deep respect for tradition, and his efforts to modernise the Ijebu nation while preserving its cultural heritage.



His reign of 65 years made him one of Nigeria’s longest-serving traditional rulers.



There was a mild drama at the venue, as traditionalists invaded the burial site, just before religious rite was performed



Recall that a controversial burial rites law was signed by the Ogun State Government, which gives powers for monarchs to be buried according to their religious beliefs, a breakaway from the norms, culture and traditions once practiced.



Specifically, Section 55 of the Obas and Chiefs Law of Ogun State 2021 provides a framework for the preservation and regulation of traditional burial rites for traditional rulers.



While subsection (ii) of the section acknowledges the right of a traditional ruler to be buried in accordance with customary practices, subsections (iii) to (v) establish procedural safeguards for the application of such customs.



The traditionalists who came in their numbers were however prevented by security operatives from the Nigeria Army, who marched them to the gate.



Speaking after the interment of the late monarch, Governor Abiodun extolled the virtues of Adetona, describing him as a great philanthropist, who can do anything for his friends.



The governor, who described the late monarch as his father, said the monarch stood by him when he had accident in London.



He also said that late Oba Adetona stood by him in the open and in secret in his journey to the Government House in 2019.



He described him as, “a royal father like no other, bold, principled, and fiercely devoted to the progress of his people, Kabiyesi redefined traditional leadership in Nigeria. For 65 years, he stood tall as a custodian of history, culture, and integrity”



He was a great philanthropist, whose voice resonated far beyond Ijebuland, speaking truth to power, mentoring generations, instituting legacies and shaping public discourse with clarity and courage”



He described him as a reliable father to his people, stating that in recognition of what Kabiyesi did for him as a person, on assumption of office, he awarded Ijebu-Ode -Mojoda-Epe road in his honour.



Abiodun, who came to the burial venue from Brazil, said it would have pained him if the late Kabiyesi, was was buried in his absence.



Speaking with newsmen, the Senator representing Ogun East, Otunba Gbenga Daniel, commended the forthright leadership of the late Oba Adetona, describing him as a fearless monarch who never shield from speaking truth to power.



Daniel stated that one of the best ways to honour the late monarch, who reigned for 65 years was to ensure the actualisation of the creation of a new State out of the old Ijebu Province because it was one of the long-cherished dreams of the late monarch.



Daniel said, “I think it is common knowledge that in Kabiyesi Awujale, Oba Sikiru Kayode Adetona, you have a personality who can speak truth to power at any time and who can be described as fearless, who abhors people telling lies and who is straight forward to a fault.



“Kabiyesi is not anyone who used to be diplomatic, he says it as it is. In the course of that, he garnered some detractors, but at the end of the day, people said that he had virtually won all the battles that life threw at him. He was indeed a forthright personality.



He added that given the strong wish of the royal father to get a new state created out of old Ijebu Province, all the powers that be must rally round to ensure that the dream of a new state becomes a reality to immortalise the highly revered traditional ruler.



Daniel explained that “the entire community is definitely good about the creation of the state. The argument has been that of the 24 Provinces created in 1924, only Ijebu Province has not been made a state, and on that account alone, everyone believes that this error needs to be corrected.



We know that particularly in a democratic dispensation, it is not that easy to create a state, it involves lots of arguments, lobbying and all that. But we feel very strongly that once the course is just I am hoping that sooner or later, especially now that Kabiyesi is no more, the power that be will seize this opportunity to honour and immortalize him with the state creation.”



On his part, a former governor of the state, Ibikunle Amosun, said the departure of the monarch was not only a huge loss to the people of Ijebuland, but to the entire state in particular and Nigeria in general.



He said, “His departure is not only a huge loss to the people of Ijebuland but to all of us in Ogun State, and indeed, Nigeria.



“I extend my heartfelt condolences to the Adetona Royal Family, the Ijebu Traditional Council, and the entire people of Ijebuland as they mourn the exit of Kabiyesi – a respected monarch and a royal colossus.



“Since his ascension to the throne as the Awujale of Ijebuland 65 years ago, Oba Adetona’s reign has been marked by service and an unwavering commitment to the development of his people and the upliftment of traditional institutions.



Through his wisdom, courage, and leadership, he transformed the Awujale’s stool into one of the most respected royal institutions in Nigeria”.



“Kabiyesi distinguished himself as a pillar of stability and a rallying point across Yorubaland and Nigeria, leaving behind a lasting imprint of a successful reign. His patriotic passion, courageous interventions in matters of public interest, and commitment to truth earned him national admiration and respect”.



“His legacy will live on through the countless lives he touched and the culture and traditions he upheld during his reign. I pray that Almighty Allah (SWT) will grant our revered Kabiyesi Aljannah Firdaus, and give the Anikinaiya Royal House, the Ijebu Traditional Council, and the good people of Ijebuland the fortitude to bear this irreparable loss”.



On his part, Aremo Olusegun Osoba said, he was grateful to God that the late Oba Adetona lived a fulfilled life. His reputation, not only in Ijebu, but in Ogun State and Nigeria in general remained intact.



“He had a sharp faculty and brain, because he still spoke with the governor on phone few hours before he died. Today is a day of celebration for a great monarch.



He added, “I can never forget him, because we usually speak at least two to three hours everyday. We normally discussed topical issues since last 14 years.



Also speaking, the 2023 governorship candidate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Ladi Adebutu, said the legacy left by Adetona, would live long after his demise.



He described him as a forthright person, who speak the truth always, adding that he was a custodian of culture.



Also, the Ogbeni Oja of Ijebuode, Olorogun Sunny Kuku, described Adetona as a revered monarch, a lover of culture who used his position to promote the town to the global world with the popular and yearly Ojude Oba Festival.
