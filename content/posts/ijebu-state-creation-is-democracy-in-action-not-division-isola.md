**The Foundation of My Conviction**


As a proud biological son of Ogun State from Egbaland, I write today not as a politician seeking advantage, but as a statesman who has witnessed firsthand the transformative power of proper governance structures. 

My journey from Chairman of Abeokuta North Local Government to Secretary of Ogun State Government, from Federal Minister for Mines and Steel Development to Nigerian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, has afforded me unique insights into the mechanics of effective administration and the critical importance of balanced federalism.


Having served at every tier of government—local, state, federal, and international—I have observed how administrative efficiency correlates directly with manageable governance units. 

My experience representing Nigeria in the United Kingdom, a nation that successfully balances unity with regional autonomy through its constituent countries, has reinforced my conviction that true strength lies not in unwieldy centralization, but in the empowerment of constituent units to realize their full potential.
The Economic Imperative for Ijebu State.


During my tenure as Minister for Mines and Steel Development, I witnessed how geographical and cultural cohesion enhances resource management and economic development. The Ijebu nation, with its distinct cultural identity, entrepreneurial spirit, and substantial natural and human resources, possesses all the fundamental requirements for successful statehood.


The Ijebu people have consistently demonstrated exceptional business acumen and educational advancement.

 From the bustling commercial activities of Ijebu-Ode to the industrial potential of Sagamu, from the agricultural richness of Ijebu-North to the strategic positioning of Ijebu-East, this region has consistently punched above its weight economically. However, these achievements have been constrained by administrative bottlenecks and resource allocation challenges inherent in the current oversized state structure.


An Ijebu State would unlock unprecedented economic opportunities. With focused governance, targeted infrastructure development, and streamlined administrative processes, the region could become a model for sustainable development in Nigeria. The creation of Ijebu State would not diminish Ogun State's potential; rather, it would allow both entities to flourish independently while maintaining beneficial inter-state cooperation.


Administrative Efficiency and Democratic Representation


My experience as Secretary to Ogun State Government provided me with intimate knowledge of the administrative challenges posed by managing diverse cultural and geographical zones within a single state structure. The current Ogun State, while rich in diversity, faces inherent challenges in ensuring equitable representation and resource distribution across its varied constituencies.


The Ijebu area, with its unique traditional institutions, cultural practices, and developmental needs, often requires specialized attention that is diluted within the broader state framework. Creating Ijebu State would ensure that the specific needs of this distinct cultural group receive focused governmental attention, leading to more efficient service delivery and accelerated development.


Furthermore, an Ijebu State would enhance democratic participation by creating governance structures that are more directly accountable to the people. Smaller, more cohesive administrative units historically demonstrate better democratic outcomes, as evidenced by successful federal systems worldwide.
The Diplomatic Dimension: Lessons from International Experience.


My diplomatic service in the United Kingdom provided invaluable insights into how successful nations manage diversity within unity. The UK's model of constituent countries—England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland—demonstrates that political autonomy can strengthen rather than weaken national cohesion. Each country maintains its distinct identity and governance preferences while contributing to the collective strength of the United Kingdom.


Similarly, Nigeria's federal system was designed to accommodate our nation's incredible diversity. The creation of Ijebu State aligns perfectly with this federal principle, ensuring that distinct cultural groups can govern themselves effectively while remaining integral parts of the Nigerian federation. This approach has proven successful in other Nigerian contexts, as evidenced by the generally positive outcomes of previous state creation exercises.


Cultural Preservation and Modern Governance


The Ijebu people possess a rich cultural heritage that deserves protection and celebration. The traditional institutions of Ijebuland, including the revered office of the Awujale, represent centuries of sophisticated governance systems that predate colonial administration. An Ijebu State would provide the appropriate governmental framework to honor these traditions while embracing modern democratic principles.


This is not about cultural chauvinism or ethnic segregation; it is about creating governance structures that reflect and respect Nigeria's beautiful diversity. Just as we celebrate the distinct contributions of various Nigerian cultures to our national tapestry, we must ensure that our political structures enable each group to contribute optimally to national development.


Addressing Potential Concerns


Some may question why an Egba son would advocate for Ijebu State creation. My response is rooted in my deep understanding of true leadership and statesmanship. Leadership transcends narrow ethnic or regional considerations; it demands that we support initiatives that serve the greater good, even when they may not directly benefit our immediate constituencies.


The creation of Ijebu State would not diminish Egbaland's influence or development prospects. Instead, it would create a healthier competitive environment that would spur development across all regions. A more balanced Ogun State, focusing on Egba and Yewa areas, would likely become more efficient and development-oriented.


Furthermore, the economic and social connections between Egba and Ijebu peoples are so deeply intertwined that the success of one invariably benefits the other. Many of our families, businesses, and cultural institutions span both regions. An Ijebu State would simply formalize a recognition of distinct administrative needs while preserving these beneficial relationships.


The Path Forward: Strategic Implementation


The creation of Ijebu State requires careful planning and strategic implementation. Drawing from my experience in government and international relations, I propose a phased approach that ensures smooth transition and optimal outcomes:


Phase One: Comprehensive Feasibility Studies* - Detailed assessments of economic viability, administrative requirements, and resource allocation mechanisms must be conducted. This should involve experts in public administration, economics, and constitutional law.


Phase Two: Stakeholder Engagement* - Extensive consultations with traditional rulers, community leaders, business organizations, and civil society groups across both proposed states must be undertaken to ensure broad-based support and address legitimate concerns.


Phase Three: Constitutional and Legal Framework* - Proper legal instruments must be developed to guide the transition process, ensuring compliance with constitutional requirements and protection of existing rights and obligations.


Phase Four: Infrastructure and Institution Building* - Strategic investments in administrative infrastructure, human resources development, and institutional capacity building must be planned and implemented.
Economic Projections and Development Potential.


An independent Ijebu State would inherit substantial economic assets and development potential. The region's industrial base, including significant manufacturing and agro-processing capabilities, provides a solid foundation for state-level economic planning. The strategic location along major transportation corridors enhances trade and commerce potential.


Conservative estimates suggest that an Ijebu State could achieve significant improvements in key development indicators within the first decade of operation. With focused governance and strategic investment, improvements in education, healthcare, infrastructure, and economic diversification are not just possible but probable.


The entrepreneurial culture of the Ijebu people, combined with their historical emphasis on education and innovation, positions an Ijebu State for remarkable success in Nigeria's evolving economic landscape. This would create a positive demonstration effect that could inspire similar transformations across Nigeria.
Environmental and Sustainable Development Considerations.


Modern state creation must incorporate environmental sustainability and climate resilience into planning processes. An Ijebu State would be well-positioned to implement innovative environmental management strategies, drawing from both traditional ecological knowledge and contemporary best practices.


The region's diverse ecosystems, from coastal areas to inland forests, require specialized management approaches that could be more effectively implemented through focused state-level environmental policies. This represents an opportunity for Nigeria to demonstrate leadership in sustainable development at the sub-national level.


Conclusion: A Vision for Inclusive Progress


The creation of Ijebu State represents more than administrative restructuring; it embodies a vision of inclusive progress that honors Nigeria's diversity while strengthening our collective capacity for development. As someone who has served Nigeria at various levels and witnessed the transformative power of good governance, I am convinced that this initiative deserves serious consideration and support.


My advocacy for Ijebu State creation stems from a deep understanding of governance dynamics, economic development principles, and the imperative of creating political structures that serve our people effectively. This is not about division; it is about multiplication—multiplying opportunities, multiplying representation, and multiplying our collective capacity for progress.


I call upon fellow Nigerians, regardless of their ethnic or regional origins, to examine this proposal based on its merits rather than narrow considerations. The creation of Ijebu State would strengthen Nigeria's federal system, enhance democratic governance, and create new opportunities for development that would benefit not just the immediate region but our entire nation.


The time has come for bold leadership and visionary thinking. The creation of Ijebu State represents both of these qualities. As we work toward a more perfect Nigerian union, we must embrace initiatives that honor our diversity while strengthening our unity. Ijebu State creation is precisely such an initiative.


Together, we can build a Nigeria where every group feels represented, every region can optimize its potential, and every citizen enjoys the benefits of good governance. The creation of Ijebu State is a strategic step toward this noble goal.
