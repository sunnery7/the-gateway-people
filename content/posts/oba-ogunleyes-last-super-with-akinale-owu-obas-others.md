He was not his usual self!. At least his looks and physical figure suggested that all was not well with him.



The more Oba (Dr.) Olufemi Ogunleye, the Towulade of Akinale tried to conceal his state of health, the more it became crystally cleared that all was not well with the royal father.



Out of curiosity, this reporter asked the Owu monarch with whom he had been relating since his days at the defunct Nigeria Airways about his health condition and he retorted: "I am managing"



Truly, Oba Olufemi Ogunleye, cladded in a traditional "Aso Oke" was managing as he welcomed the Olowu of Owu -Abeokuta, Oba Saka Adelola Matemilola and other Owu monarchs to his palace amid drumming, singing and dancing.



Although, Oba Ogunleye had a lean physique different from his usual looks, he managed to welcome guests.



The occassion was the 5th meeting of the Royal Union of Owu Obas which was hosted by the late veteran journalist and  Public Relations impresario.



Tuesday, April 16, 2024, would forever be remembered by the Akinale inhabitants, an Owu town in Ewekoro Local Government Area of Ogun State as the day Oba Ogunleye re-enacted the Biblical "Last Super".



The "Last Super" is a powerful symbol of Jesus' love, sacrifice, and legacy, shaping Christian theology and practice to this day.



The Akinale's occassion was also supported by many sons and daughters of the town that has been witnessing rapid growth and development since Oba Ogunleye's enthronment many years back.



Akinale was founded by the legendry hunter and warrior, Odetoyinbo Akanni Lapeleke and his two siblings.



Lapeleke's siblings were Majeogbe and Akinwale, circa 1836 through 1840 which shortly made Akinale became the epicentre of Owu Peace Keeping Militia (OPKM).



The OPKM was headed by Lapeleke and supported by his compatriots who included Jogunomi, Ojukotimi, Akindele Gbaalefa, Awayesonlu and Sangojinmi Gudugba among other vibrant game hunters.



The legends were the arrow heads of Owu Militia in the Egba Allied Forces that liberated Abeokuta  from the interloping Dahomeyans amazon of the war century.



When Lapeleke was intensifying his expedition, he left Akinwale behind to hold fort and traversed another forest in search of games.



Lapeleke later settled in a community which was later named after him and over the years has transformed to national economic resource for cement production in Nigeria.



In what appeared as the "last supper" by the ebullient monarch was meant to deliberate on the unity and corporate development of the Owu people.



However, it also exhibited the cultural endowment of the Owu people in Akinale



The Olowu of Owu Abeokuta, Oba (Prof.) Saka Adelola Matemilola, Otileta VII led other Owu Obas within and outside the state to the occasion.



Chief Olu Fatoki, Oganla Owu, Crescent University's Head of Department of Mass Communication, Kola Adesina, Mr. Williams, formerly of the Ogun State Information & Strategy Miniatry  among others were in attendance.



Before the meeting went into private session, Oba Ogunleye while welcoming his brother Obas, Baales and chiefs expressed gratitude to God for making the day possible.



He canvassed continued love and unity among the Owu people irrespective of their status.



While describing Balogun Owu, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, GCFR  as the strength and hope of the Owu people,  Oba Ogunleye also acknowledged supports of the Olowu of Owu-Abeokuta, Oba Matemilola, Alhaji Moshood Ola Yusuf among other Owu personalities.



The royal father also appreciated the gallantry of Owu Baales, leaders and hunters in the zone. 



He particularly mentioned Chief Mukaila Sekoni, Baale Oke Oko and Dagunro Towulade of Akinale.



Oba Ogunleye also gave kudos to the immediate past governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun as well as Hon. Isiaka Ibrahim, Chief Sarumi Akinale and Obagbo Owu, Chief Olusegun Oyindasola for their unending supports at all times.



The royal father did not end his address without paying tribute to the late Balogun Erunmu, Chief Ekundayo Opaleye whom he described as a bosom friend and mentor.



In the reminiscence of his great grandparents hunting prowess, dignitaries including the visiting royal fathers left the community with pieces of roasted antelope.



Intermittent booming of guns by local hunters amid cultural displays by Egungun masqueraders, drummers and others made the day memorable. 



Members of the "Amotekun", joined  by other local guards and other plained-clothes security personnel made the venue secured as Owu drummers joined in entertainment of guests.



Gourds of original palm wine were freely served among other edible and assorted drinks.



Olori Ogunleye among others, ensured that all present, irrespective of their status  were served with available menus and drinks.



In an organised advocacy, the anti human trafficking agency in Ogun State solicited supports and cooperation of the royal fathers.



Before June 19, 2024 when he joined his ancestors, he was an uncommon royal father and journalist who loved education and pursued it vigorously becoming a lawyer at over 70 years of age and later capped it all with a doctoral degree.



Had he not suddenly succumbed to the cold hands of death, Oba Ogunleye would have joined other graduates at the last convocation of Babcock University, Ilishan-Remo, Ogun State on July 13, 2024 as a proud holder of Ph.D in Law.



Oba Ogunleye would also have celebrated his 80th birthday on September 23, 2024 which now turns out to be his posthumous birthday.



Adieu, Oba Olufemi Ogunleye, my maternal monarch, my senior professional colleague and a man who always encouraged one to do good to mankind.
