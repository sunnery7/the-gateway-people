First, I want to celebrate my brother Hon Ladi Adebutu, Lado I recall how dismally our party had performed over the years to such a point that it almost seemed PDP would never do well in Ogun state especially Ogun Central where we have won nothing since 2007 when with the benefit of reflection our so-called win was a spectacle of ugliness and from then on we did not even win a councillorship till 2023 where our fortunes changed remarkably. I must thank you for this.



I will be failing if I do not thank your beloved father Odole Adebukola Kessington Adebutu, what a man, what an elder, what a father, besides his huge war chest, he is patient, fatherly and a constant support for you and our efforts. On behalf of all of us, Baba I thank you, sir



In Ogun East, although we have had mixed fortunes there, and we have been somewhat strong in that area this last outing in 2023 was a wowing moment for me.



Make no mistake about it, we won convincingly and notwithstanding the orgy of violence, we still won and our numbers could have been more humiliating for our rivals had what I consider an appropriate rerun had been ordered but hey you are now the go-to man for Ogun East and you can be very proud of this, for I am proud of you and all our dedicated members.



Our weakest link is Ogun West, I know that for reasons best known to our so-called leaders in Ogun West they simply betrayed all the love, trust, support and comradery leaving the zone unmanned, allowing us to suffer a bloody nose. We will firm up our lines and get our party the PDP ready for the future.



I marvel at your largeness of heart and courage for I know how hard it is to manage politicians especially to meet their needs, wants and indulgences. I thank you on behalf of everyone.



The Supreme Court has decided and that is the end of the legal journey as allowed by our constitution.



You and I had a long and public spat on the way to the ticket, I am sorry if I hurt you while that lasted but I am sure you bear testimony that when the legal crossing of swords was halted, I as a dutiful party man worked very hard and I am happy  in conjunction with others delivered our Abeokuta Federal Constituency with more than 5000 margins of win, the highest in the governorship election for Ogun 2023 governorship race. 



That is how politics must be, we must not always insist that if we don’t have our way the house must crumble.



I will be failing if I do not thank your beloved father Odole Adebukola Kessington Adebutu, what a man, what an elder, what a father, besides his huge war chest, he is patient, fatherly and a constant support for you and our efforts. On behalf of all of us, Baba I thank you, sir.



Sai Lado, my dear brother as we sing in Ijebu eyi ma dun to eee, eyin ma dun to eee, eni ba so pe ko dun to ko se tire ka woran…anyone one who says you have not done nobly should do his or her own let us see.



Tomorrow promises to be a more beautiful day.



I salute you.
